Q: Vincent can buy a bundle of 3 fresh flowers for $2.50 or a bundle of 2 fresh flowers for $1. If he buys 18 flowers at the better price, how much money does he save?
A:Vincent can buy 3 flowers for $2.50 or 2 flowers for $1. To find the better deal, we need to compare the cost per flower. For the bundle of 3, each flower costs $2.50 / 3 = $0.83. For the bundle of 2, each flower costs $1 / 2 = $0.50. So the better deal is buying the bundle of 2 flowers.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at $0.50 each, he would spend 18 * $0.50 = $9.

If he were to buy 18 flowers at $0.83 each, he would spend 18 * $0.83 = $14.94.

Therefore, he saves $14.94 - $9 = $5.94 when buying the better deal.

Q: Gloria finds a pair of boots within her shoe budget at a store. However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels, which together cost $5 less than the boots. If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, what is the price of the boots?
A:Let the cost of the boots be x. Then the cost of the two pairs of high heels is x - 5. If one pair costs $33, then the other pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. Therefore, the total cost of the high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the total cost of the high heels is x - 5, we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = $99

Solving for x:

x = $99 + 5
x = $104

Therefore, the price of the boots is $104.

Q: In a neighborhood, the number of pet rabbits is 12 less than the total number of pet dogs and cats. If the ratio of cats to dogs is 2 to 1 and there are 60 dogs, how many pets are there in total in the community?
A:If there are 60 dogs, and the ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1, then there are 60/2 = 30 cats in the neighborhood. 
The total number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 30 (cats) = 90. 
Since the number of pet rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats, there are 90 - 12 = 78 pet rabbits in the neighborhood. 
Therefore, the total number of pets in the community is 60 (dogs) + 30 (cats) + 78 (rabbits) = 168.

Q: Sophia is considering a road trip and wants to know how far a tank of gas can take her. Since her last fill-up, she has driven 100 miles, and she needs to add 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again. According to her car's manual, her gas tank can hold 12 gallons. How far can a tank of gas take Sophia?
A:Sophia's gas tank can hold 12 gallons, and she needed to add 4 gallons to fill it up again. This means she had used up 12 - 4 = 8 gallons of gas. Since she drove 100 miles on 8 gallons, we can calculate that she can drive 100 / 8 = 12.5 miles per gallon. Therefore, on a full tank of 12 gallons, she can drive 12.5 x 12 = 150 miles in total. Sophia can go 150 miles on a full tank of gas.

A:For the adult dinosaurs, 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad is needed.
For the juvenile dinosaurs, each will eat half the amount of the adults, so 10 / 2 = 5 pounds per juvenile.
So, the juvenile dinosaurs will need 5 x 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.
Therefore, Ted needs to bring a total of 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad for all the dinosaurs at the picnic.

Q: Uriah's backpack is too heavy for him. He needs to reduce its weight by 15 pounds. Each of his comic books weighs 1/4 pound and each toy weighs 1/2 pound. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?
A:Uriah needs to reduce the weight of his backpack by 15 pounds. If each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, then removing 30 comic books would reduce the weight by 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. To reach the desired weight reduction of 15 pounds, he needs to remove a total of 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds more. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys. The answer is 15.

Q: Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. He can make 10 taper candles from one pound of beeswax. The cost of one pound of beeswax and the required wicks is $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00 and makes and sells 20 candles, what is his net profit?
A:Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, so he can make 20 candles from 2 pounds of beeswax. 
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, which means each candle costs $10.00 / 20 = $0.50 to make.
If he sells each candle for $2.00, his total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.
His total cost for making 20 candles is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
Therefore, his net profit is $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00. 
Charlie's net profit is $30.00.

Q: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every evening. She buys several boxes of ice cream, each with 15 servings, for $4.00 per box. After 60 days, how much has she spent on ice cream?
A:Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every evening, so she goes through one box of 15 servings every 15 days. Since she bought several boxes, let's say she buys 4 boxes. 
Each box costs $4.00, so 4 boxes cost 4 x 4 = $16.00. 
If she goes through one box every 15 days, then in 60 days, she will have gone through 60 / 15 = 4 boxes. 
So in 60 days, she will have spent 4 x $4.00 = $16.00 on ice cream. 
The answer is $16.00.

Q: Artie has a flower stall at the farmers' market selling marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He normally sells a pot of marigolds for $2.74, a pot of petunias for $1.87, and a pot of begonias for $2.12. Artie does not have change today, so he decides to round all prices. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much does he earn?
A:To calculate Artie's earnings, we first need to round the prices of the pots. 
- A pot of marigolds rounded to the nearest dollar is $3. 
- A pot of petunias rounded to the nearest dollar is $2. 
- A pot of begonias rounded to the nearest dollar is $2. 

Now, we calculate Artie's earnings:
- 12 pots of marigolds at $3 each is $36. 
- 9 pots of petunias at $2 each is $18. 
- 17 pots of begonias at $2 each is $34. 

Adding these amounts together, Artie earns $36 + $18 + $34 = $88. 

Therefore, Artie earns $88 from selling 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias.

Q: Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, but her jumping speed is half her running speed. If she can jump 3 miles per hour, and spends one-third of a 6-hour period running and two-thirds walking, how far does she cover?
A:First, we need to figure out Dana's running speed. Since her running speed is four times her walking speed and her jumping speed is half her running speed, her running speed must be 4 x 3 = 12 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of a 6-hour period running, so she runs for 6 / 3 = 2 hours.

In 2 hours, she covers 12 x 2 = 24 miles while running.

Dana spends two-thirds of the 6-hour period walking, so she walks for 6 x (2/3) = 4 hours.

During the 4 hours of walking, she covers 3 x 4 = 12 miles.

In total, Dana covers 24 + 12 = 36 miles.

Q: The dragon Pelg stops at the top of Mount Farbo and breathes fire at everything within 1,000 feet. Polly can throw the only known dragon-slaying spear 400 feet, just within the dragon's fire range. But when Polly holds a sapphire, she can throw the spear three times farther than without it. If Polly holds the stone, how far outside the dragon's fire range can she stand to strike it with the spear?
A:If Polly can throw the spear three times farther with the sapphire, then she can throw it 400 * 3 = 1200 feet with the stone. Since the dragon's fire range is 1000 feet, Polly can stand at a distance of 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside the dragon's fire range to strike it with the spear. The answer is 200 feet.

The third layer has an area of half of 8, which is 4. 
The bottom layer has an area of half of 4, which is 2. 

Now, let's calculate the total area of all layers: 
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30. 

Since there are 4 layers, we can find the average area by dividing the total area by the number of layers: 
30 / 4 = 7.5. 

Therefore, the average area of each layer of Luke's sandcastle is 7.5.

Q: There are 20 students in a dance class. 20% of the students enrolled to learn modern dance, and 25% of the remaining students enrolled to learn jazz dance. What percentage of the students enrolled to learn hip-hop dance?
A:First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in modern dance. 20% of 20 students is 20/100 * 20 = 4 students. 
So, the remaining students after the modern dance enrollment is 20 - 4 = 16 students. 
Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 25/100 * 16 = 4 students. 
Therefore, the total number of students who enrolled in either modern or jazz dance is 4 (modern) + 4 (jazz) = 8 students. 
This means the remaining students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 8 = 12 students. 
So, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance out of the total 20 students, which is 12/20 * 100% = 60%. 
Therefore, 60% of the students enrolled to learn hip-hop dance.

Q: Cecilia just bought a puppy. According to the vet's advice, she must feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. Then for the remainder of the puppy's life, she must feed it 2 cups of dog food per day. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?
A:For the first 180 days, Cecilia will need 1 cup of dog food per day. So for the first 180 days, she will use 1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups of dog food.
For the remainder of the year (365 days total), she will need 2 cups of dog food per day. So for the remaining 365 - 180 = 185 days, she will use 2 cups/day x 185 days = 370 cups of dog food.
In total, for the first year, Cecilia will use 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups of dog food.
Since one bag contains 110 cups, she will need 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags of dog food for the first year. Answer: 5 bags.

Q: Stephen orders household items online. His final bill amount is $40.00. Because this order is processed through a delivery provider, they add a 25% fee on his final bill total and charge him a $3.00 delivery fee. Stephen also adds a $4.00 tip. After adding these additional charges, what is the final price Stephen pays for the household items?
A:The final bill amount is $40.00. A 25% fee on $40.00 is 0.25 * $40 = $10.00. So, the total bill amount after adding the fee is $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00. Adding the $3.00 delivery fee, the total becomes $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00. Finally, adding the $4.00 tip, the final price Stephen pays for the household items is $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00. The answer is $57.00.

Q: According to the nutritional information, each serving of chips in a bag contains 250 calories. If a 300-gram bag of chips contains 5 servings, and your daily calorie target is 2,000 calories and you've already consumed 1,800 calories, how many grams of chips can you still eat?
A:Each serving of chips in a 300-gram bag contains 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in the bag, so the total calories in the bag is 250 * 5 = 1250 calories.
If you've already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000 calories, then you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to consume.
Since the bag of chips contains 1250 calories, you can still eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings of chips.
Since there are 5 servings in the bag, you can still eat 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams of chips. 
So, you can still eat 240 grams of chips.

Q: I have 10 liters of orange juice drink, two-thirds of which is water, and I want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice drink, three-fifths of which is water, but I spilled 1 liter of orange juice while pouring. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters of drink?
A:First, calculate how much water is in the 10 liters of orange juice drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 10 * 2/3 = 6 liters of water.
Next, calculate how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple juice drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 15 * 3/5 = 9 liters of water.
After spilling 1 liter of orange juice, you have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange juice left.
Now, add the remaining orange juice and the pineapple juice together. 9 liters of orange juice + 15 liters of pineapple juice = 24 liters of drink.
Finally, add the remaining 6 liters of water in the orange juice to the 9 liters of water in the pineapple juice to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of drink. 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters of water. The answer is 15 liters.

Q: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, the first day for 3 hours, and the next two days for half the time of the first day. What is his running speed?
A:John runs 60 miles a week in a total of 3 days. 
Let's say his speed is x miles per hour.

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours at x miles per hour, so he covers 3x miles.
On the next two days, he runs for 1.5 hours each at the same speed, so he covers 1.5x miles on each day.
Therefore, the total distance covered in the week is 3x + 1.5x + 1.5x = 60 miles.

So, 6x = 60
x = 60 / 6
x = 10 miles per hour

John's running speed is 10 miles per hour.

Q: Carlos is planting a lemon tree. Planting the tree costs $90. The tree produces 7 lemons per year, each selling for $1.50. Watering and fertilizing the tree costs $3 per year. How many years does it take for Carlos to start making money from this lemon tree?
A:To calculate how many years it takes for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree, we need to consider the costs of planting and maintaining the tree, as well as the income from selling lemons. 

The total cost to plant the tree is $90, and the annual cost of watering and fertilizing is $3. So, the total annual cost is $90 + $3 = $93. 

The annual income from selling lemons is 7 lemons x $1.50 per lemon = $10.50. 

To start making money, Carlos needs to cover the annual cost with the income from selling lemons. So, he needs to make at least $93 in a year. 

Let's calculate how many years it will take for him to start making money: 

$93 (annual cost) / $10.50 (annual income) = 8.86 years 

Since Carlos cannot sell a fraction of a lemon, it will take 9 years for him to start making money from the lemon tree.

The company has a policy that for employees who have worked for 5 years, the annual salary for each such employee can be increased by 10% of the initial salary. If Sylvia just completed 5 years at the company last December, what will her annual salary be after another three years?
A:Sylvia's initial monthly salary is $600, and her initial annual salary is $600 x 12 = $7200. After completing 5 years, her salary was increased by 10% to $7200 + $7200 x 0.10 = $7920 per year. 

After another three years, her salary will be $7920 x 3 = $23760 per year. Therefore, her annual salary after another three years will be $23760.

A:Cara can normally download 2 GB per minute, so to download a 200 GB file, it would take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes. 
However, after downloading 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. 
So she has to restart the download from the beginning, meaning she will have to download the full 200 GB file again. 
In total, it will take her 100 minutes to download the first 80 GB + 20 minutes for the restart + 100 minutes for the remaining 120 GB = 220 minutes. 
Therefore, it will take her 220 minutes in total to download the file.

Q: Gant is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. The first person says there are 80 beans. The second person's guess is half the first person's guess plus 20. The third person's guess is 25% more than the first person's guess. What is the average of their guesses?
A:The first person guessed 80 beans.
The second person guessed (80/2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 beans.
The third person guessed 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100 beans.

To find the average of their guesses, add up their guesses and divide by the number of people:
(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

Therefore, the average of their guesses is 80 beans.

Q: In a class of 200 fifth graders, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts. How many girls are not Girl Scouts?
A:First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the class. 

2/5 of 200 fifth graders are boys, so there are 200 * (2/5) = 80 boys. 
The rest, 200 - 80 = 120, are girls. 

2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts, so the number of Girl Scouts is 120 * (2/3) = 80. 
Therefore, the number of girls not in Girl Scouts is 120 - 80 = 40. 

So, there are 40 girls in the class who are not Girl Scouts.
