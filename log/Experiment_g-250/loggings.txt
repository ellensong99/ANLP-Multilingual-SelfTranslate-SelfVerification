Q: Jenny helps in her mom's office. She has a stack of 60 letters that need stamps and a stack of letters that already have stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the stack that already have stamps, how many letters were in that stack when Jenny started stamping?
GT : 10
True: Jenny started with 60 letters needing stamps. She put stamps on 1/3 of them, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters. So there are now 30 letters in the stack that already have stamps. If 20 letters needed stamps and there are now 30 with stamps, then originally there were 60 - 20 - 30 = 10 letters in the stack that already had stamps. The answer is 10.
False: Jenny started with 60 letters that needed stamps. She put stamps on one-third of them, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters. So there were 60 - 20 = 40 letters left needing stamps. If there are 30 letters in the stack that already have stamps, then the total number of letters when Jenny started stamping was 40 + 30 = 70. The answer is 70.
False: Jenny had a stack of 60 letters that needed stamps. She put stamps on one-third of them, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters. So there were 60 - 20 = 40 letters in the stack that already have stamps. If now there are 30 letters in the stack with stamps, then there must have been 40 + 30 = 70 letters in that stack when Jenny started stamping. The answer is 70.
10.0 - 2: Jenny started with 60 letters needing stamps and X letters that already have stamps. After she put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters, there were only 10 letters left in the stack needing stamps. So, we can write the following equation: 60/3 + 10 = X 20 + 10 = X X = 30 The answer is 30.
70.0 - 3: Jenny started with 60 letters needing stamps. She put stamps on one-third of them, which means 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters now have stamps. So, the total number of letters before putting stamps on any of them was 60 + 20 = 80 letters. If there are now X letters in the stack that already have stamps and there were 70 letters in the stack when Jenny started stamping, we can write the following equation: <code> X + 70 = 80  X = 10 </code> The answer is 10.

Q: Mark is a copy editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, and they each pay him a different price per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences a week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How many cents does Mark earn per week?
GT : 7500
True: If Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and a total of 1,000 sentences per week, then he edits 1,000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A. Since Publisher B pays him twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B. So he earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B. In total, Mark earns 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents per week. The answer is 7500 cents.
True: Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays Mark 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences a week, so he earns 500 * 5 + 500 * 10 = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents per week. Therefore, Mark earns 7500 cents per week.
True: If Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, that means Publisher B pays him 5 cents x 2 = 10 cents per sentence.
Since Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences a week, he earns (5 cents x 500 sentences) from Publisher A and (10 cents x 500 sentences) from Publisher B.
Therefore, Mark earns (5 cents x 500) + (10 cents x 500) = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents per week. 
Therefore, Mark earns 7500 cents per week.

Q: Dave bought a large pack of fries before a hungry seagull stole the pack from his hands after he had eaten 14 fries. When the seagull landed, it devoured half the amount of fries Dave had eaten. Then 3 pigeons chased it away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries. How many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?
GT : 48
False: Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dave had eaten 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack.
2. The seagull then ate half of the 14 fries Dave had eaten, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. After the seagull landed, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
4. The 3 pigeons each ate 3 fries, which is a total of 3 x 3 = 9 fries.
5. After the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. (This doesn't make sense because you can't have negative fries).
6. Since there can't be negative fries, it seems there is a mistake or inconsistency in the calculations provided.

So, it's difficult to determine the initial number of fries in the pack based on the information given.
False: Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries from the pack.
2. The seagull ate half of the fries Dave had eaten, which is 14/2 = 7 fries.
3. After the seagull, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
4. The 3 pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 fries.
5. After the pigeons, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. This doesn't make sense, so let's correct this.
6. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 7 = 4.66666... Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, let's assume the raccoon took 5 fries.
7. After the raccoon, there were 7 - 5 = 2 fries left.
8. The ants carried away the last fry, leaving 2 - 1 = 1 fry.
9. However, the final count was said to be 5 fries. Therefore, there were originally 5 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

So the answer is 5 fries.
False: Dave initially had eaten 14 fries, so the seagull devoured half of that amount, which is 14/2 = 7 fries. After the pigeons ate 3 fries each, they ate a total of 3*3 = 9 fries. So, after the incident with the seagull and pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = -2 fries, which is not possible. This means there was an error in the calculations, and we need to reassess the problem to find the correct number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it.
6.0 - 0: Let's break this down step by step:   1. Dave bought 60 fries. 2. A seagull stole the pack after Dave ate 14 fries, leaving 46 fries. 3. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave had eaten, which is 7 fries. So, there were 46 - 7 = 39 fries left. 4. X pigeons chased the seagull away and each pigeon ate X fries. So, the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is X * X = X^2. 5. After the pigeons ate, there were (39 - X^2) fries left. 6. A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3. So, there were (39 - X^2) / 3 fries left. 7. The ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries. So, (39 - X^2) / 3 = 5. 8. Solving for X, we get: (39 - X^2) / 3 = 5 39 - X^2 = 15 -X^2 = -24 X^2 = 24 X = √24 X = 4.9 (rounded off to the nearest whole number) Therefore, the answer for 'X' is 5.
5.0 - 0: Let's break down the problem step by step:  1. Dave bought a pack of fries with 50 fries. 2. After he ate 14 fries, there were 36 fries left. 3. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries that Dave had eaten, so 7 fries were eaten by the seagull. 4. After the seagull ate the fries, there were 29 fries left. 5. 'X' pigeons chased the seagull away. Each pigeon ate 'X' fries, so in total, 'X' * 'X' = 'X'^2 fries were eaten by the pigeons. 6. After the pigeons ate their share, there were 29 - 'X'^2 fries left. 7. The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the fries. 8. Ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries.  We can set up the equation like this: 36 - 'X'^2 * 'X' * 2/3 = 5  Solving the equation: 36 - 2/3 * 'X'^3 = 5 2/3 * 'X'^3 = 31 'X'^3 = 31 * 3/2 'X'^3 = 46.5 'X' ≈ 3.76  Therefore, the value of 'X' is approximately 3.76.
-2.0 - 0: Let's break it down step by step:  1. Dave bought the pack with 2 missing fries, so he had X fries + 2. 2. After the seagull stole the pack and devoured half of the fries Dave had eaten (14/2 = 7 fries), there were X + 2 - 14 - 7 = X - 19 fries left. 3. The X pigeons chased the seagull away and each ate X fries, leaving X - (X) = 0 fries. 4. The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 0 = 0 fries remaining. 5. Finally, the ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries.  So, we can write the following equation: X + 2 - 14 - 7 - X - 0 - 0 - 1 = 5 X - 19 - 1 = 5 X = 25  The answer is X = 25.

Q: Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs daily. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?
GT : 4
True: Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he must have x + 2 white chickens.

The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, so the number of eggs laid by red chickens in a day is 3x.
The white chickens lay 5 eggs a day, so the number of eggs laid by white chickens in a day is 5(x + 2).

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs daily, we can write the equation:
3x + 5(x + 2) = 42
3x + 5x + 10 = 42
8x + 10 = 42
8x = 32
x = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.
True: Let R be the number of red chickens and W be the number of white chickens. 
We know that W = R + 2 (he has two more white chickens than red chickens).
Each red chicken lays 3 eggs a day, so the number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3R.
Each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day, so the number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5W.

Given that Jerry collects 42 eggs daily, we can write the equation:
3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation:
3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R = 32
R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.
True: Let x be the number of red chickens Jerry has. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2. 

The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs they lay is 3x. The white chickens lay 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs they lay is 5(x + 2). 

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs daily, we can set up the equation: 

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42
3x + 5x + 10 = 42
8x + 10 = 42
8x = 32
x = 4

Jerry has 4 red chickens.

GT : 5,600
False: Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she must have eaten 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many as her sister, so she must have eaten 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. If one cookie contains 200 calories, then Sue intake 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister intake 5 + 13 = 18 cookies, which is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories. So Sue intake 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister. The answer is 5600.
False: On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

Q: A hospital sees 500 patients daily. Each patient's consultation lasts an average of 24 minutes. The hospital charges doctors $150 per hour and charges patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these consultations?
GT : 10000
False: First, calculate the total number of minutes spent on consultations per day: 500 patients * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes
Then convert this to hours: 12000 minutes / 60 minutes = 200 hours
Next, calculate the income from doctors' fees per day: 200 hours * $150 = $30000
And the income from patients' fees per day: 200 hours * $200 = $40000
Finally, calculate the total profit: $40000 (income from patients) + $30000 (income from doctors) = $70000
The hospital makes a profit of $70000 from these consultations.
True: The hospital sees 500 patients daily, with each consultation lasting 24 minutes. This means each patient is charged for 24/60 = 0.4 hours of consultation. 

Assuming the hospital charges doctors $150 per hour and patients $200 per hour, the hospital makes a profit of $200 - $150 = $50 per hour of consultation.

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $50 x 0.4 hours x 500 patients = $10,000 daily from these consultations.
False: Each patient consultation lasts 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. 
The hospital charges doctors $150 per hour, so for each patient, the hospital makes $150 x 0.4 = $60 from the doctors. 
The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so for each patient, the hospital makes $200 x 0.4 = $80 from the patients.
In total, for each patient consultation, the hospital makes $60 + $80 = $140. 
Therefore, from 500 patient consultations daily, the hospital makes $140 x 500 = $70,000 profit.
70000.0 - 3: First, we need to find the total number of consultation hours per day. Since each patient's consultation lasts 24 minutes, or 0.4 hours, and there are 500 patients daily: <code> Total consultation hours = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours/day </code> Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated from consultations: <code> Revenue = (X * 200) + (200 * 200)  Revenue = 200X + 40000 </code> Given that the hospital makes a profit of $70,000 from these consultations: <code> 200X + 40000 = 70000  200X = 30000  X = 150 </code> The answer is $150 per hour.
10000.0 - 4: First, we need to calculate the total number of minutes spent on consultations daily: <code> 500 patients * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes </code> Then, we can convert this to hours: <code> 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes = 200 hours </code> The hospital charges doctors X dollars per hour for consultations, so the revenue from doctors is: <code> 200 hours * X = 200X dollars </code> The hospital also charges patients $200 per hour, so the revenue from patients is: <code> 200 hours * $200 = $40,000 </code> The total profit from consultations is given as $10,000, so we can set up the following equation: <code> 200X + $40,000 - $10,000 = $10,000  200X + $30,000 = $10,000  200X = -$20,000  X = -$20,000 / 200  X = -$100 </code> Since it doesn't make sense for the hospital to charge doctors a negative amount, there might be an error in the calculation or the information provided.

The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times was the doorbell rung?
GT : 175
True: The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. The second friend rang it 1/4 times more than the first friend, so 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 25 times. The third friend rang it 10 times more than the fourth friend, so 60 + 10 = 70 times. Therefore, the total number of times the doorbell was rung is 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175 times.
True: If the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, then the third friend rang it 10 more times, which is 60 + 10 = 70 times. The second friend rang it 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend rang it 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 25 times. Adding up all the doorbell rings, we get 60 + 70 + 20 + 25 = 175 times. The doorbell was rung a total of 175 times.
True: The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times. The third friend rang it 10 times more, so the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

He made a large portion of mac and cheese, which he ate for several dinners this week, and he put 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?
GT : 31
True: Carl eats a sandwich for lunch every day, so that's 7 sandwiches using 2 slices each, totaling 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese.
He also eats a cheese and egg roll for breakfast on 3 days, with each egg roll using 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich. So each egg roll uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
For the 3 egg rolls, he uses a total of 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese.
Lastly, he puts 8 slices of cheese in the mac and cheese he made.
So in total, Carl uses 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.
True: Carl eats a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese each time. So for 7 days, he used 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch sandwiches.

For breakfast, he had a cheese and egg roll for 3 days, with each egg roll using 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese, each egg roll uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese. So for 3 days, he used 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

He also made mac and cheese for dinner, using 8 slices of cheese. 

In total, he used 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese. The answer is 31.
True: For lunch, Carl eats a sandwich using 2 slices of cheese each day, so for 7 days, he uses 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese.
For breakfast, he eats a cheese and egg roll 3 days, using 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per egg roll. This means he uses 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.
For dinner, he made mac and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.
Adding all these together, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese in total. The answer is 31.

Q: In a school auditorium with 1,000 students, there are 3 entrances A, B, and C, which also serve as exits. If after a meeting, 30% of the students exited through entrance A, and the remaining 3/5 exited through entrance B, the rest exited through entrance C. Calculate the number of students who exited through entrance C.
GT : 280
True: First, calculate how many students exited through entrance A: 1000 students * 30% = 300 students
Then calculate how many students exited through entrance B: 1000 students - 300 students = 700 students
Calculate the fraction of students exiting through entrance B: 3/5 * 700 students = 420 students
Finally, calculate how many students exited through entrance C: 1000 students - 300 students - 420 students = 280 students
Therefore, 280 students exited through entrance C.
True: First, calculate the number of students that exited through entrance A: 30% of 1,000 students is 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.
Next, calculate the number of students that exited through entrance B: 3/5 of the remaining students (1,000 - 300 = 700) is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.
Finally, calculate the number of students that exited through entrance C: The remaining students after A and B exited is 1,000 - 300 - 420 = 280 students. Therefore, 280 students exited through entrance C.
True: First, calculate the number of students who exited through entrance A: 1000 students * 30% = 300 students.
Next, calculate the number of students who exited through entrance B: 1000 students * (1 - 30%) * 3/5 = 1000 * 0.7 * 3/5 = 420 students.
The total number of students who exited through entrances A and B is 300 + 420 = 720 students.
Therefore, the number of students who exited through entrance C is 1000 - 720 = 280 students.

Q: Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as last year. After baking, he realizes he actually made 15 cookies more than he intended. While cooling the cookies, he dropped 5 cookies, and now he has 110 cookies in total. How many cookies did Henry make last year?
GT : 50
True: Henry ended up with 110 cookies. He made 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually made 110 - 15 = 95 cookies intended. He also dropped 5 cookies while cooling, so he made 95 + 5 = 100 cookies in total. Since he wanted to make twice as many as last year, he made 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year. The answer is 50.
False: Let x be the number of cookies Henry intended to make this year. He made 15 more than that, so the total number of cookies he made is x + 15. He also dropped 5 cookies, so he actually has x + 15 - 5 = x + 10 cookies. Since he wanted to make twice as many as last year, we can set up the equation x + 10 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, Henry intended to make 10 cookies this year, which means he made 10 + 15 = 25 cookies in total. The answer is 25.
True:  Henry intended to make cookies twice as many as last year, which means x * 2 cookies. However, he made 15 more cookies than he intended, so the total number of cookies he made is x * 2 + 15. After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 left, so x * 2 + 15 - 5 = 110. This simplifies to x * 2 + 10 = 110. Therefore, x * 2 = 100, x = 50. Therefore, Henry made 50 cookies last year.
50.0 - 6: Henry made 50 cookies last year. He intended to make twice as many, which would be 50 x 2 = 100 cookies. But he actually made 15 more than that, so he made 100 + 15 = 115 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has X cookies in total. So, we can write the following equation: <code>115 - 5 = X  X = 110 </code> The answer is 110.
25.0 - 0: Henry made 25 cookies last year. This year, he wanted to make twice as many, which would be 25 x 2 = 50 cookies.

Q: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is he to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers (expressed as a percentage)?
GT : 25
False: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, 6) and 2 consecutive even numbers (2, 4 or 4, 6). So the likelihood of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 0.5, while the likelihood of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 2/6 = 0.33. The difference in likelihood is 0.5 - 0.33 = 0.17. To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.17 * 100 = 17%. So Jerry is 17% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers.
False: There are 4 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, 6) and there are 3 ways to roll two consecutive even numbers (2-4, 4-6, 2-6) out of a total of 36 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 4/6 = 2/3. 
The probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 3/36 = 1/12. 

The difference in probabilities is 2/3 - 1/12 = 7/12. 
Multiplying by 100 to get the percentage, we get 7/12 * 100% = 58.33%. 

So Jerry is 58.33% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers.
False: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), and there are 3 possible pairs of consecutive even numbers (2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8 on a regular die). Therefore, the chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 50%, and the chance of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 3/6 = 50%. Since they are equally likely, there is no percentage difference between the two scenarios.

GT : 1
True: Kalinda can assemble 4 pieces per minute, while her mom can assemble 2 pieces per minute (half of Kalinda's rate). So, together they can assemble 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. 

If the puzzle has 360 pieces, then they will need 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle together. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they will need 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle. 

Therefore, they will need 1 hour to complete the puzzle.
False: Kalinda can assemble 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can do half as many, so she can do 4/2 = 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can assemble 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. 

If the puzzle has 360 pieces, they will need 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle together. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they will need 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle together. 

Therefore, Kalinda and her mom will need 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.
True: Kalinda can assemble 4 pieces per minute, so her mom can assemble 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can assemble 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. If the puzzle has 360 pieces, they will need 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete it. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they will need 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle. The answer is 1 hour.
1.0 - 5: Let's break down the problem. Kalinda can assemble 'X' pieces per minute, and her mom can assemble half of that, so her mom can assemble X/2 pieces per minute. Together, they can assemble X + X/2 = 1.5X pieces per minute.  Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, they need to work for 360 / 1.5X minutes to complete it. Given that they need 1.0 hours to complete the puzzle, which is equivalent to 60 minutes, we can set up the following equation:  360 / 1.5X = 60  Solving for X:  360 / 1.5X = 60 240 = 1.5X X = 160  Therefore, the answer is that Kalinda can normally assemble 160 pieces per minute.
360.0 - 0: Let's assume Kalinda can assemble X pieces per minute. Her mom can assemble half that number, so her mom can assemble X/2 pieces per minute. Together, Kalinda and her mom can assemble X + X/2 = 3X/2 pieces per minute. There are 360 pieces in total, and they need 360/((3X/2) minutes to complete the puzzle. Since they need 360.0 hours to complete the puzzle, we have: 360/((3X/2) = 360.0 2*360 = 3X 720 = 3X X = 240 So, Kalinda can assemble 240 pieces per minute.

There is a 20% delivery charge on top of the $20, so that's 20% of $20 which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
Adding the delivery charge to the total cost gives $20 + $4 = $24 for the order. 
Lori also wants to tip $5.00, so the final cost of her order is $24 + $5 = $29. 
The total cost of Lori's order is $29.
True: Lori ordered 2 submarine sandwiches for $7.50 each, 2 bags of fries for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each, so the total cost of the food items is (2 * $7.50) + (2 * $1.50) + (2 * $1.00) = $15 + $3 + $2 = $20.

There is a 20% delivery charge on the food items, so the delivery charge is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.

Adding the delivery charge to the total food cost, the total cost before tipping is $20 + $4 = $24.

Lori wants to tip $5.00, so the total cost of her order, including the tip, is $24 + $5 = $29.

Therefore, Lori's order costs $29 in total.

Q: Kim founded his own housekeeping service company and is calculating how much profit he can make from his clients. He already has 3 clients but is negotiating with 5 potential clients, confident enough to include them in his calculations. Cleaning each client's house will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2, and each pack of cloths costs $5. These are his only expenses. According to calculations, his total weekly income will be $92. Considering profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much profit does Lucas make per week?
GT : 20
True: Kim currently has 3 clients, and will potentially have 5 more. So in total, he will have 3 + 5 = 8 clients.
Each client's house cleaning requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So for 8 clients, he will need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach and 8 packs of cloths.
The total cost of bleach will be 16 bottles * $2 = $32.
The total cost of cloths will be 8 packs * $5 = $40.
So his total weekly expenses will be $32 + $40 = $72.
Given his total weekly income is $92, his profit will be $92 - $72 = $20 per week. 
Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 per week.
True: Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, which means he will have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Q: Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Layla's. Four years later, his salary has increased, and his income is 40% higher than it was four years ago. If Adrian's salary and Layla's salary rise simultaneously, and Adrian's income was $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary of both people four years later.
GT : 95200
False: Let Layla's salary be x.
Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Layla's, so Adrian's salary is 1.3x.
If Adrian's income was $40,000 four years ago, after a 40% increase, his current salary is 40,000 * 1.4 = $56,000.
So, 1.3x = $56,000
x = $56,000 / 1.3 = $43,076.92 (Layla's current salary)
Total salary of both people four years later = $43,076.92 + $56,000 = $99,076.92. 
Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later is $99,076.92.
True: Adrian's income four years ago was $40,000. After a 40% increase, his income is now 40,000 + (40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000. 

Since Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Layla's, Layla's income four years ago would be 40,000 - (40,000 * 0.30) = $28,000. 

After a 40% increase, Layla's income is now 28,000 + (28,000 * 0.40) = $39,200. 

Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later is $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200.
True: Adrian's income four years ago was $40,000. His salary is now 40% higher, so his current salary is $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000. Layla's salary is 30% lower than Adrian's, so Layla's current salary is $56,000 - ($56,000 * 0.30) = $39,200. 

Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later is $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200.
99076.92 - 0: To solve this problem, we first need to find Layla's salary four years ago. If Adrian's income was $40,000 four years ago and increased by 40%, then his income four years later would be: \[ \$40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = \$40,000 \times 1.40 = \$56,000 \]  Since Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Layla's, we can set up the following equation: \[ Layla's\ salary = \$56,000 / (1 + 0.30) = \$56,000 / 1.30 = \$43,076.92 \]  Now, let's calculate the total salary for both Adrian and Layla four years later: \[ Total\ salary = Adrian's\ salary\ four\ years\ later + Layla's\ salary\ four\ years\ later \] \[ Total\ salary = \$56,000 + \$43,076.92 = \$99076.92 \]  Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later is $99,076.92.
95200.0 - 0: To solve this problem, we first need to find Layla's initial salary. Since Adrian's salary is 30% higher than Layla's, we can set up the following equation: Let Layla's initial salary be X.  Adrian's initial salary = X + 0.3X = 1.3X Given that Adrian's income was $40,000 four years ago, we have: 1.3X = $40,000 X = $40,000 / 1.3 X = $30,769.23 (approximately)  Now, Adrian's current salary is 40% higher than his initial salary, we can calculate his current salary: Adrian's current salary = $40,000 * 1.4 = $56,000  Layla's current salary would be 30% less than Adrian's current salary, so: Layla's current salary = $56,000 - 0.3($56,000) Layla's current salary = $56,000 - $16,800 Layla's current salary = $39,200  The total salary of both people four years later would be: $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200  Therefore, the total amount of sales for the month of June is $95,200.

To find how many pounds they need per day, we divide 35 by 7 (days in a week).
So, 35 / 7 = 5 pounds of insects per day. The answer is 5.
True: Each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For a group of 10 ducks, they would need to eat 3.5 x 10 = 35 pounds of insects per week.

Q: Russell works at a pet shop and is allocating straw to rodents. The mice are kept in 3 cages, each mouse getting 6 straws. The hamsters are kept individually in 10 cages, each hamster getting 5 straws. Additionally, there is a cage of rabbits that received 20 straws. No other straw is used anywhere else in the pet shop. If 160 straws were given to small rodents, how many mice are there per cage?
GT : 5
False: First, let's calculate how many straws were given to the mice:
3 cages of mice * 6 straws per mouse = 18 straws for the mice

Then, let's calculate how many straws were given to the hamsters:
10 cages of hamsters * 5 straws per hamster = 50 straws for the hamsters

Adding the straw given to the rabbits, we get:
18 straws for the mice + 50 straws for the hamsters + 20 straws for the rabbits = 88 straws in total

Since 160 straws were given in total, we can subtract to find out how many straws were given to the mice:
160 total straws - 88 straws for all other animals = 72 straws for the mice

Therefore, there were 72 straws given to the mice. Since each mouse got 6 straws, we can divide to find out how many mice are in each cage:
72 straws for the mice / 6 straws per mouse = 12 mice per cage

So, there are 12 mice per cage.
False: First, we need to determine how many straws were given to the mice, hamsters, and rabbits:

- The 3 cages of mice received 3 * 6 = 18 straws.
- The 10 cages of hamsters received 10 * 5 = 50 straws.
- The cage of rabbits received 20 straws.

In total, the small rodents received 18 + 50 + 20 = 88 straws.

Since 160 straws were given to small rodents in total, this means that there are 160 - 88 = 72 straws additionally given.

Since each mouse in a cage gets 6 straws, we can set up an equation to find the number of mice:

3 cages * x mice per cage * 6 straws per mouse = 72 additional straws
3x * 6 = 72
18x = 72
x = 72 / 18
x = 4

Therefore, there are 4 mice per cage.
False: First, we need to calculate the total number of straws given to the mice and hamsters. Each mouse gets 6 straws and there are 3 cages, so the mice received 6 * 3 = 18 straws. Each hamster gets 5 straws and there are 10 cages, so the hamsters received 5 * 10 = 50 straws. The cage of rabbits received 20 straws. In total, the small rodents received 18 + 50 + 20 = 88 straws. Since 160 straws were given in total, this means there are 160 - 88 = 72 straws left for the mice. Since each mouse gets 6 straws, this means there are 72 / 6 = 12 mice per cage. Therefore, there are 12 mice per cage.
12.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given: - There are 3 cages of mice, with each mouse getting 6 straws. - There are 12 mice per cage, so there are a total of 3*12 = 36 mice. - The hamsters are kept individually in X cages, with each hamster getting 5 straws. - There is a cage of rabbits that received 20 straws. - In total, 160 straws were given to small rodents.  Given this information, we can create the following equation: \(36*6 + X*5 + 20 = 160\)  Solving this equation: \(216 + 5X + 20 = 160\) \(236 + 5X = 160\) \(5X = 160 - 236\) \(5X = -76\) \(X = \frac{-76}{5}\)  Therefore, the answer for 'X' is -76/5, which is -15.2. Since we can't have a negative number of cages, it is not a valid solution.
4.0 - 0: The total number of straws given to mice can be calculated as 3 cages * 6 straws per mouse = 18 straws per cage. Let's assume there are 'Y' hamster cages. The total number of straws given to hamsters can be calculated as Y cages * 5 straws per hamster = 5Y straws. In addition, there is a cage of rabbits that received 20 straws. Therefore, the total number of straws given to small rodents is 18 + 5Y + 20 = 160 straws. <code> 18 + 5Y + 20 = 160  5Y + 38 = 160  5Y = 122  Y = 122 / 5  Y = 24.4 </code> Since the number of cages must be a whole number, we cannot have a fraction of a cage. Therefore, there are 24 hamster cages. So, the answer is 24.

Q: Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. They spend 3 dollars on lemons and 2 dollars on sugar for every gallon of lemonade they make. They can make 20 cups per gallon, selling each cup for 0.50 dollars. If their profit is 25 dollars, how much did they spend on lemons?
GT : 15
True: First, let's calculate the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. They spend 3 dollars on lemons and 2 dollars on sugar for every gallon, so the total cost per gallon is 3 + 2 = 5 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost per cup of lemonade. Since they can make 20 cups per gallon, the cost per cup is 5 / 20 = 0.25 dollars.

Now, let's calculate their revenue. They sell each cup for 0.50 dollars, so their total revenue is 0.50 * 20 = 10 dollars per gallon.

To calculate their profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: 10 - 5 = 5 dollars profit per gallon.

If their total profit is 25 dollars, then they must have made 25 / 5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.

Finally, to calculate how much they spent on lemons, we multiply the number of gallons (5) by the cost to make one gallon (3 dollars): 5 * 3 = 15 dollars. 

Therefore, they spent 15 dollars on lemons.
False: To find out how much they spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue. Since they sell each cup for 0.50 dollars and can make 20 cups per gallon, their revenue per gallon is 0.50 * 20 = 10 dollars. 

If their total profit is 25 dollars, then their total revenue must be their profit plus their expenses. Let x be the cost of lemons per gallon. So their total revenue is x - (3 + 2) = x - 5.

We can set up an equation: x - 5 = 25
Solving for x, we get x = 30

Therefore, they spent a total of 30 dollars on lemons.
True: To find out how much they spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue. 

They sell each cup for $0.50 and can make 20 cups per gallon, so they make $0.50 x 20 = $10 per gallon of lemonade.

If their profit is $25, then their total revenue must be $25 + their total costs. Let's call the cost of lemons L.

Their total costs include $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so their total costs for each gallon of lemonade is $3 + $2 = $5.

Let's assume they made X gallons of lemonade. So their total revenue is $10 x X = $10X.

Now we can set up the equation: $25 + $5X = $10X.

Subtract $5X from both sides: $25 = $5X.

Divide both sides by $5: X = 5.

Therefore, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. Since they spent $3 on lemons for each gallon, they spent $3 x 5 = $15 on lemons. So, they spent $15 on lemons.
15.0 - 1: Let's break this down step by step:  1. They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar for every gallon of lemonade, so their total cost for ingredients per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 2. They can make X cups per gallon, and they sell each cup for $0.50, so they make $0.50*X for every gallon of lemonade they sell. 3. Their profit is $25, so their total revenue from selling lemonade must be $25 + $15 (the cost of lemons) = $40. 4. Therefore, the number of cups per gallon, X, can be calculated by setting up the equation:  Revenue - Cost = Profit $0.50*X - $5 = $25  Solving for X: $0.50*X = $30 X = $30 / $0.50 X = 60  Therefore, the answer is that they can make 60 cups per gallon of lemonade.
30.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given: - They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar for every gallon of lemonade. - They can make X cups per gallon. - They sell each cup for $0.50. - Their profit is $25. - They spent $30 on lemons.  First, let's calculate the cost per gallon: <code> Cost per gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 </code>  Since they spent $30 on lemons, they must have bought 10 gallons of lemonade: <code> Number of gallons = $30 / $3 = 10 gallons </code>  Since they spent $5 per gallon and made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be: <code> Total revenue = $25 (profit) + $50 (cost of 10 gallons) = $75 </code>  If they make X cups per gallon, then the total number of cups they made is: <code> Total number of cups = X cups/gallon x 10 gallons = 10X cups </code>  Since they sell each cup for $0.50, their total revenue should be: <code> Total revenue = $0.50 x 10X = $5X </code>  We already know their total revenue is $75, so: <code> $5X = $75  X = $75 / $5  X = 15 </code>  Therefore, the answer is 15 cups per gallon.

Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool:
L = 4S 

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
4S - 4 = 2(S - 4) 
4S - 4 = 2S - 8 
2S = 4 
S = 2 

Therefore, currently there are 2 gallons of water in the smaller pool.
False: Let's denote the amount of water in the smaller pool as S and the larger pool as L. 

Four minutes ago, the amount of water in the larger pool was 4*4 = 16 gallons more than the water in the smaller pool, so:

L - 16 = S

Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool, so:

L = 4S

Substitute the value of L from the second equation into the first equation:

4S - 16 = S
3S = 16
S = 16/3
S = 5.33 gallons

So, currently, there are approximately 5.33 gallons of water in the smaller pool.
False: Let x be the amount of water in the smaller pool currently. Four minutes ago, the larger pool had 4(x + 4) gallons of water (due to the leaks), and the smaller pool had x + 4 gallons of water. The larger pool now has 4(x) gallons of water. Since the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool four minutes ago, we can set up the equation:
4(x + 4) = 2(x + 4)
4x + 16 = 2x + 8
2x = 8
x = 4
Therefore, the smaller pool currently has 4 gallons of water.
2.0 - 0: Let's assume the smaller pool has a capacity of S gallons and the larger pool has a capacity of L gallons.  Initially, both pools had water leaking at a rate of X gallons per minute. After 4 minutes, the amount of water in the larger pool was twice the amount in the smaller pool. So, we can write the equation: <code>(L - 4X) = 2(S - 4X) </code>  After some time, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool. At this point, the amount of water in the smaller pool is 2.0 units. So, we can write the equation: <code>(L - 4X + 4X) = 4(2.0) </code>  Given that the smaller pool has 2.0 units of water, we can substitute S = 2.0 into the equation. Then we can solve for X: <code>(2.0) - 4X = 2  2.0 - 4X = 2  - 4X = 0  X = 0 </code>  Therefore, the answer is X = 0 gallons per minute.
5.33 - 0: Let's denote the initial amount of water in the smaller pool as S and in the larger pool as L. The larger pool had twice the water as the smaller pool 4 minutes ago, so L = 2S.  After 4 minutes, the smaller pool lost 4X gallons of water and the larger pool lost 4X gallons x 4 = 16X gallons of water.  So the current amount of water in the smaller pool is S - 4X = 5.33.  Likewise, the current amount of water in the larger pool is L - 16X = 4(5.33) = 21.32.  Now we substitute L = 2S into the equation: 2S - 16X = 21.32 2(5.33 + 4X) - 16X = 21.32 10.66 + 8X - 16X = 21.32 -8X = 10.66 - 21.32 -8X = -10.66 X = 1.33  Therefore, the answer is X = 1.33.
4.0 - 1: Let's denote the initial amount of water in the larger pool as L, and the initial amount of water in the smaller pool as S.   Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool. So we have: L - 4 = 2(S - 4)  Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool. So we have: L = 4S  Given that there is currently 4.0 units of water in the smaller pool: S = 4  Substitute S = 4 into L = 4S: L = 4(4) L = 16  Now we can find the value of 'X' by setting up the equations for the leaking rates in each pool: Lose of water in larger pool per minute = L*X Lose of water in smaller pool per minute = S*X  As the final amount of water in the smaller pool is 4 units, we have: 4 - 4X = 0 4X = 4 X = 1  So, the answer is X = 1.

GT : 98
False: To achieve an average score of 93, Brinley will need a total of [93 * 6 = 558] points after all six tests. 
His total points from the first five tests are 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. 
Therefore, to reach a total of 558 points, he will need to score 558 - 438 = 120 on the sixth test. 
Brinley needs to score 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.
False: Brinley's total score for the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. To achieve an average of 93 for 6 tests, his total score needs to be 93 x 6 = 558. Therefore, Brinley needs to score 558 - 438 = 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.
False: Brinley's scores on the first five tests add up to 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. To achieve an average of 93, he needs a total of 93 * 6 = 558 points for all six tests. To find out what score he needs on the sixth test, subtract his current total from the desired total: 558 - 438 = 120. Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

Q: Juliet is preparing for a dinner party at her home and plans to serve stew. She noticed that she ran out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new pack. Later, her husband also bought a pack of 5 new spoons and gave them to Juliet. When Juliet was taste-testing the stew, she used 3 spoons. Later, when she was setting up the cutlery, there were a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the pack Juliet bought?
GT : 10
False: To solve this problem, let's track the spoons:

Juliet bought a pack of spoons, and her husband also bought 5 spoons. So Juliet initially had the pack she bought + the 5 spoons her husband bought = total spoons before taste-testing the stew.

After taste-testing the stew with 3 spoons, Juliet had 12 spoons left in total.

So, initially, Juliet had pack + 5 = 12 - 3 = 9 spoons left.
Therefore, the pack Juliet bought originally had 9 - 5 = 4 spoons. 

So, the pack Juliet bought originally contained 4 spoons.
False: To find out how many spoons were in the pack Juliet bought, we need to work backwards. 

She used 3 spoons for taste-testing, so that leaves 12 - 3 = 9 spoons for setting up the cutlery. 

Her husband bought 5 new spoons, and when combined with the ones Juliet bought, there were 9 + 5 = 14 spoons. 

Therefore, Juliet bought a pack of 14 spoons.
False: Let x be the number of spoons in the pack Juliet bought. 
After her husband gave her 5 more spoons, there are now x + 5 spoons. 
So, the total number of spoons is x + x + 5 = 12
This simplifies to 2x + 5 = 12
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 2x = 7
Dividing by 2, x = 3.5
Since you can't have half a spoon, the pack Juliet bought must have had 3 spoons. 

Therefore, Juliet bought a pack of 3 spoons.
4.0 - 2: Juliet originally bought a pack with 4 spoons. Her husband bought a pack of 5 spoons. She used 3 spoons for taste-testing. So, the total number of spoons at the end would be: \[4 + 5 - 3 = X\] \[X = 6\]  So, the answer is 6.
14.0 - 0: Juliet originally bought a pack of 14 spoons. Her husband bought 5 more spoons and she used 3 spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had for the dinner party can be calculated as: <code> 14 + 5 - 3 = X  16 = X </code> The answer is 16.
3.0 - 0: At first, Juliet bought a pack of spoons with 3 spoons. Then her husband bought a pack of 5 spoons. So, the total number of spoons is 3 + 5 = 8. Later, Juliet used 3 spoons for taste-testing, so the number of spoons left for setting up the cutlery is 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, the answer is X is 5.

Q: Chad ordered a custom wrap for lunch. The base wrap costs $6.50. He added $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and 2 sauces at $0.25 each. He decided to spend an additional $3.00 to upgrade his meal with fries and a drink. He has a $5.00 gift card to use at checkout. How much more does he need to pay?
GT : 9
True: Chad's custom wrap costs $6.50 for the base wrap + $2.00 for meat + $1.00 for cheese + $1.00 for avocado + 2 sauces at $0.25 each = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00 for the wrap. 

Adding the $3.00 upgrade for fries and a drink brings the total to $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Subtracting the $5.00 gift card, Chad needs to pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00 more. 

Chad needs to pay $9.00 more.
False: The total cost of the wrap with all the add-ons is 6.50 + 2 + 1 + 1 + (0.25 * 2) = $10. The upgraded meal with fries and a drink costs an additional $3. After applying the $5.00 gift card, Chad needs to pay 10 + 3 - 5 = $8. Chad needs to pay $8 more.
True: Chad's total cost for the wrap is $6.50 (base) + $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.25 (sauce) + $0.25 (sauce) = $11.00. 
Adding the upgrade for fries and a drink, the total cost is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. 
After using the $5.00 gift card, Chad needs to pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00 more. 
He needs to pay $9.00 more.
9.0 - 0: Chad's total expenses for the custom wrap and upgrade are calculated as follows: Base wrap ($6.50) + Meat ($2.00) + Cheese ($1.00) + Avocado ($1.00) + Sauces (2 * $0.25) + Upgrade ($3.00) = $14.00. Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00. Therefore, the answer for 'X' is $9.00.
8.0 - 0: Chad's total cost for the custom wrap and upgrade is the sum of all the individual costs: Base wrap: $6.50 Meat: $2.00 Cheese: $1.00 Avocado: $1.00 Sauces: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50 Upgrade: $3.00 Total cost = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00  Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so he needs to pay the remaining amount: Total cost - Gift card = $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00  Therefore, the answer is $9.

Q: There are 4 birds in a birdhouse. Sally No.2 is 3 years older than Grandma Red. Grandma Red's age is twice that of Sally No.4. If Sally No.4 and Sally No.32 are the same age, and Sally No.32 is 8 years old, how old are the 4 birds combined?
GT : 51
True: First, we need to find the ages of Sally No.4 and Grandma Red. Since Sally No.32 is 8 years old, Sally No.4 must also be 8 years old. Therefore, Grandma Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Next, we need to find the age of Sally No.2. Since she is 3 years older than Grandma Red, she must be 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all 4 birds:
Sally No.4 (8 years old) + Sally No.2 (19 years old) + Grandma Red (16 years old) + Sally No.32 (8 years old) = 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51.

Therefore, the combined age of the 4 birds is 51 years.
True: We know that Sally No.32 is 8 years old, so Sally No.4 is also 8 years old. This means that Grandma Red is twice the age of Sally No.4, which is 8 x 2 = 16 years old. Sally No.2 is 3 years older than Grandma Red, so she is 16 + 3 = 19 years old. 

So the total age of the 4 birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years old. The answer is 51.
True: First, we need to figure out the ages of each bird:
- Sally No.32 is 8 years old.
- Sally No.4 is the same age as Sally No.32, so she is also 8 years old.
- Grandma Red's age is twice that of Sally No.4, so she is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
- Sally No.2 is 3 years older than Grandma Red, so she is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the 4 birds: 
8 (Sally No.32) + 8 (Sally No.4) + 16 (Grandma Red) + 19 (Sally No.2) = 51

The total age of the 4 birds combined is 51 years old.

True: There are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars, making a total of 12 + 4 = 16 cars that are not semi-automatic. Therefore, there are 20 - 16 = 4 semi-automatic cars. To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100. So, (4/20) x 100 = 20%. Therefore, 20% of the cars in the fleet are semi-automatic.
True: There are a total of 20 cars. 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, so the remaining must be semi-automatic. 

20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

(4 / 20) * 100 = 20%

So 20% of the cars in the fleet are semi-automatic.
True: There are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars, which totals to 12 + 4 = 16 cars. That means there are 20 - 16 = 4 semi-automatic cars. To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we calculate 4 cars out of 20 total cars, which is 4/20 = 0.2. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100 to get 20%. Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

If they both finish all their fruit roll-ups, how many did they eat on average?
GT : 45
True: To find out how many fruit roll-ups each of them ate on average, first we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had. 
Beatrice had a fruit roll-up that was 2 wide and 24 long, so she had 2 x 24 = 48 fruit roll-ups.
Mashelle had a fruit roll-up that was 3 wide and 14 long, so she had 3 x 14 = 42 fruit roll-ups.

Together, they had 48 + 42 = 90 fruit roll-ups. 
To find out how many they ate on average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are 2 of them): 90 / 2 = 45. 
Therefore, on average, they each ate 45 fruit roll-ups.
True: Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 2 x 24 = 48 fruit roll-ups.
Mashelle's fruit roll-up is 3 x 14 = 42 fruit roll-ups.
In total, they ate 48 + 42 = 90 fruit roll-ups.
On average, they each ate 90 / 2 = 45 fruit roll-ups.

Q: John won an award at work. The award includes a cash prize equal to 1 times 5,000 dollars and a 5% raise. If he earns 2,000 dollars every week (every week of the year), and he won the award on the first day of the year, how much does he earn that year?
GT : 114,200
False: The cash prize is 1 times 5,000 dollars, which is equal to 5,000 dollars. His 5% raise on his weekly salary of 2,000 dollars is 2,000 * 0.05 = 100 dollars. So, his total earnings for that year would be 2,000 * 52 weeks (weeks in a year) + 5,000 (cash prize) + 100 (raise) = 104,000 + 5,000 + 100 = 109,100 dollars. Therefore, John earns 109,100 dollars that year.
False: The cash prize is 5,000 dollars. The 5% raise on his weekly salary of 2,000 dollars is 2,000 * 0.05 = 100 dollars. So in total, he earns an additional 5,000 + 100 = 5,100 dollars from the award and raise. Adding this to his weekly salary, he earns 2,000 + 5,100 = 7,100 dollars per week. 

Since he won the award on the first day of the year, he will earn 7,100 dollars per week for 52 weeks in a year. So his total earnings for the year will be 7,100 * 52 = 369,200 dollars. 

Therefore, John will earn 369,200 dollars that year.
False: John's cash prize is 1 times 5,000 dollars, which is 5,000 dollars. His 5% raise would be 2,000 * 0.05 = 100 dollars. So his total earnings for that year would be 2,000 + 100 + 5,000 = 7,100 dollars. The answer is 7,100 dollars.
109100.0 - 0: John's total earnings for the year can be calculated as follows: - Weekly earnings = $2,000 - Cash prize = $X,000 - Raise = X%  John's total earnings for the year, including the cash prize and raise, is given as $109,100. So, we can write the equation: <code> $2,000 * 52 weeks + $X,000 + $X,000 * X/100 = $109,100 $104,000 + $X,000 + $X,000 * X/100 = $109,100 $X,000 + $X,000 * X/100 = $5,100 $X,000 * (1 + X/100) = $5,100 (X/100 + 1) * X = 5.1 X^2 + 100X - 5,100 = 0 </code> We can solve for X using the quadratic formula. This will give us the value of X.
369200.0 - 0: Let's break down the total earnings for the year: - John's weekly earnings: 2,000 dollars per week. - The cash prize: X.000 dollars. - The raise percentage: X%.  So, in a year, John earned: <code> 2,000 * 52 (weeks in a year) = 104,000 (weekly earnings for the year)  X + 104,000 (total earnings with cash prize)  X% of 104,000 (total earnings with raise) = 104,000  Total earnings for the year: 104,000 (weekly earnings) + X.000 (cash prize) + X% of 104,000 (raise) = 369,200 </code> We can use this information to solve for X.
7100.0 - 0: John's total earnings for the year include his weekly earnings of 2000 dollars, the cash prize of X.000 dollars, and the raise of X%. If we add them together, it should equal 7100.0. <code> 2000 (weekly earnings) + X.000 (cash prize) + X% (raise) = 7100.0  (X.000 + X% + 2000) = 7100.0 </code> Since X is both the cash prize and raise, we can simplify the equation to: <code> 2X + 2000 = 7100  2X = 5100  X = 2550 </code> The answer is 2550.

Q: Deborah is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees enter and leave in a day. She saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, then she saw half that number return in the next 6 hours. She saw twice the number she first saw leave the hive and leave in the following 6 hours. Then, each bee that had previously left and not yet returned came back to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Deborah see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?
GT : 75
False: In the first 6 hours, Deborah saw 30 bees leave the hive. In the next 6 hours, half that number returned, which is 30/2 = 15 bees. In the following 6 hours, twice the number that left initially left the hive, so 30 x 2 = 60 bees left. Then, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that had previously left and not yet returned came back, which is 30 (the initial number that left). Therefore, Deborah saw 30 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
False: In the first 6 hours, Deborah saw 30 bees leave the hive. Half that number, which is 30/2 = 15 bees, returned in the next 6 hours. Then, twice the number she first saw leave, which is 30*2 = 60 bees, left in the following 6 hours. Therefore, in total she saw 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees leave the hive. If all the bees that left then returned in the last 6 hours, she would see 105 bees return to the hive. The answer is 105.
False: Let's break it down:

- In the first 6 hours, Deborah saw 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, she saw half that number return, so 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned.
- In the following 6 hours, she saw twice the number leave, so 30 * 2 = 60 bees left.
- In the last 6 hours, each bee that had previously left and not yet returned came back. So 60 - 15 (who already returned) = 45 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, Deborah saw 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
6.0 - 2: Let's break down the information given: - In the first X hours, 30 bees left the hive. - In the next X hours, half that number (15 bees) returned. - In the following X hours, twice the number that left initially (60 bees) left the hive. - In the next X hours, all the bees that had previously left and not yet returned came back. - In the last 6 hours of the day, 6 bees returned to the hive.  Based on this information, we can create the following equation: In the end, the number of bees that left the hive initially (30), minus the number of bees that returned in the next X hours (15), plus the number of bees that left after that (60), minus the number of bees that came back in the last X hours (6) should equal the total number of bees that returned to the hive at the end.  <code>30 - 15 + 60 - 6 = 6 69 = 6 X = 6 </code>  The answer is 6.
105.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given step by step:  1. Deborah saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 'X' hours. 2. Half that number (15 bees) returned in the next 'X' hours. 3. Twice the number she first saw leave the hive (60 bees in total) left in the following 'X' hours. 4. Each bee that had previously left and not yet returned came back to the hive in the next 'X' hours. 5. Deborah saw 105.0 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.  Let's calculate 'X': - In the first 'X' hours, 30 bees left the hive and 15 bees returned. So, at this point, there are 30 - 15 = 15 bees that are still outside the hive. - In the next 'X' hours, 60 bees left the hive, and the 15 bees that were outside the hive returned. So, there are now 60 - 15 = 45 bees outside the hive. - In the last 6 hours, 105 bees return to the hive. Since all the bees that had previously left and not yet returned came back to the hive, it means that 105 bees were outside the hive.  - Therefore, we have: 15 (remaining from the first phase) + 45 (from the second phase) + 105 (returned in the last 6 hours) = 165 bees in total.  So, 'X' can be calculated as: <code> 15 (remaining from the first phase) + 45 (from the second phase) = X  15 + 45 = X  X = 60 </code>  The answer is 60.

Q: Brian's friend Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5. If Brian had 20 video games but lost 5 just before the comparison, how many does Bobby have?
GT : 40
False: Brian had 20 video games originally but lost 5, so he had 20 - 5 = 15 video games before the comparison. Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian, so he has 15 / 3 = 5 video games. The answer is 5.
False: Brian initially had 20 video games. But just before the comparison, he lost 5. So he had 20 - 5 = 15 video games. Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian, which means he has 3 * 15 = 45 fewer video games. So Bobby has 15 - 45 = -30 video games. Since you can't have negative video games, the answer is 0.
False: First, determine how many video games Brian had before losing 5. Brian had 20 video games initially, but lost 5, so he had 20 - 5 = 15 video games for the comparison.

Now, calculate how many video games Bobby has. Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian, so Bobby has 15 / 3 = 5 video games.

Therefore, Bobby has 5 video games.
5.0 - 1: Let's break it down: - Brian has X video games but lost 5, so he had X - 5 before the comparison. - Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5, so Bobby has (3 * (X - 5)). - If Bobby has 5 video games, then: <code>3 * (X - 5) = 5 X - 5 = 5 / 3 X = (5 / 3) + 5 X = 6.67 + 5 X = 11.67</code>  Therefore, the answer is 11.67.
0.0 - 1: Let's break down the information given:  1. Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5. 2. Brian had X video games but lost 5 just before the comparison. 3. Bobby has zero video games.  From point 3, we can infer that if Bobby has zero video games, then Brian had 5 video games before losing 5.   Now let's look at point 1: Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5. If Bobby has zero video games and Brian had 5 video games before losing 5, then Brian must have had 8 video games originally (3 times fewer than Brian minus 5 would be 0).  Therefore, the answer is 8.

GT : 33
False: James originally had 40 water-type cards. After losing 8 and buying 14 more, he now has 40 - 8 + 14 = 46 water-type cards. The total number of cards is 30 + 20 + 46 = 96. The probability of choosing a water-type card is 46/96, which is approximately 0.4792 when rounded to the nearest whole number. So the probability is 48%.
False: James originally had 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards, for a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards. After losing 8 water-type cards and buying 14 grass-type cards, he now has 32 water-type and 34 grass-type cards, for a total of 32 + 34 = 66 cards. The probability of choosing a water-type card is therefore 32/66 = 0.4848. Rounded to the nearest whole number, the probability is 48%.
False: James originally had 40 water-type cards. After losing 8 and gaining 14, he will have 40 - 8 + 14 = 46 water-type cards. 

To find the probability of choosing a water-type card, divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards:
46 (water-type cards) / (30 + 20 + 46) (total cards) = 46 / 96 = 0.479

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the probability is 48%.

Q: Bill makes 300 bread rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes daily. Each bread roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill connects all the breads end to end, how long would they be in total?
GT : 280
False: To find the total length of all the breads, we first need to calculate the total length of each type of bread.

300 bread rolls x 4 inches = 1200 inches of bread rolls
120 croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches of croissants
60 baguettes x 24 inches (2 feet = 24 inches) = 1440 inches of baguettes

Now, add up the total length of all the breads:
1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Therefore, if Bill connects all the breads end to end, they would be 3360 inches long in total.
False: First, we need to calculate the total length of the bread rolls. Since each bread roll is 4 inches long and Bill makes 300 bread rolls, the total length of the bread rolls would be 4 inches x 300 = 1200 inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long and Bill makes 120 chocolate croissants, so the total length of the croissants would be 6 inches x 120 = 720 inches.

Finally, we calculate the total length of the baguettes. Each baguette is 2 feet long, which is equivalent to 24 inches. Bill makes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes would be 24 inches x 60 = 1440 inches.

Adding up all the lengths of the bread products, we have 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches. Therefore, if Bill connects all the breads end to end, they would be 3360 inches long in total.
False: Bill makes 300 bread rolls x 4 inches = 1200 inches of bread rolls.
He makes 120 chocolate croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches of croissants.
He makes 60 baguettes x 24 inches = 1440 inches of baguettes.
In total, all the breads would be 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches long.

True: One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12. So 12 penguins jumped into the sea and another 12 went into the cave. Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 36 - 12 - 12 = 12. The answer is 12.
True: One-third of 36 penguins is 36/3 = 12 penguins. So 12 penguins jumped into the sea to swim and another 12 went into the cave to feed. That means 12 + 12 = 24 penguins are not sunbathing. So, there are 36 - 24 = 12 penguins still sunbathing. The answer is 12.
True: One-third of 36 is 36 ÷ 3 = 12. So 12 penguins jumped into the sea and 12 more went into the cave, leaving 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins still sunbathing. The answer is 12.

GT : 30
True: Let x be the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier. The total cost of one child ticket and one adult ticket is $10 + $12 = $22. If she received $8 in change, then the amount of money she gave the cashier is x = $22 + $8 = $30. So Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.
True: Since Britanny's mom paid for one child ticket and one adult ticket, the total cost would be $12 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $22. If she received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30. So, Britanny's mom gave the cashier $30.
True: One adult ticket costs $12 and one child ticket costs $10. So the total cost of both tickets is $12 + $10 = $22. If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, then she must have given the cashier $22 + $8 = $30. The answer is $30.

GT : 105
False: Mark completed the first test with 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour, so he took 75 / 5 = 15 hours to complete the first test. He had 8 hours to complete the first test, so he did not answer 15 - 8 = 7 questions on the first test.

Similarly, Mark completed the second test with 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour, so he took 100 / 5 = 20 hours to complete the second test. He had 6 hours to complete the second test, so he did not answer 20 - 6 = 14 questions on the second test.

Therefore, Mark did not answer a total of 7 + 14 = 21 questions in total. The answer is 21.
True: Mark completed the first test in 8 hours, so he answered 8 x 5 = 40 questions. He did not answer 75 - 40 = 35 questions on the first test.

For the second test, Mark completed it in 6 hours, so he answered 6 x 5 = 30 questions. He did not answer 100 - 30 = 70 questions on the second test.

Therefore, Mark did not answer a total of 35 + 70 = 105 questions. The answer is 105.
False: On the first test, Mark took 8 hours to complete 75 questions, so he answered 8 * 5 = 40 questions.
On the second test, Mark took 6 hours to complete 100 questions, so he answered 6 * 5 = 30 questions.
Therefore, Mark did not answer 75 - 40 + 100 - 30 = 5 + 70 = 75 questions. 
The answer is 75 questions.
21.0 - 0: Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test of 75 questions, so he answered 5 questions per hour. Therefore, he answered 8 * 5 = 40 questions on the first test. He had 35 questions left unanswered on the first test.   On the second test, he took 6 hours to complete 'X' questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. Therefore, he answered 6 * 5 = 30 questions on the second test. Since he did not answer 21 questions in total, we can write the following equation:  35 + 30 + X = 75 65 + X = 75 X = 75 - 65 X = 10  Therefore, the answer is 10.
105.0 - 4: Mark took 75 questions yesterday at a rate of 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed all 75 questions. Today, he took another test of X questions at the same rate for 6 hours. In total, he did not answer 105 questions, so we can write the following equation: <code> 75 + 5*8 + X + 5*6 = 105  75 + 40 + X + 30 = 105  X + 145 = 105  X = 105 - 145  X = -40 </code> The answer is -40, which doesn't make sense in this context. It's possible that there was an error in the problem statement.
75.0 - 0: For the first test, Mark completed 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour in 8 hours. So, he answered 5 x 8 = 40 questions. This means he did not answer 75 - 40 = 35 questions in the first test.  For the second test, he completed 'X' questions at the same rate in 6 hours. Since he did not answer 35 questions in the first test, those 35 questions must be part of the second test. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  35 + X = 75 X = 75 - 35 X = 40  The answer is 40.

True: Let the number of queen bees be x. Then the number of larvae is 2x, and the number of worker bees is 2(2x) = 4x. 

The total number of bees is x + 2x + 4x = 700. 
So, 7x = 700. 
Therefore, x = 100. 

Since the number of worker bees is 4x, there are 4(100) = 400 worker bees in the beehive.
True: Let the number of queen bees be x. Then the number of larvae would be 2x, and the number of worker bees would be 2(2x) = 4x. 

Given that the total number of bees is 700, we have:

x + 2x + 4x = 700
7x = 700
x = 100

So there are 4x = 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees. The answer is 400.

Therefore, Steve would need 63 / 3 = 21 vines to meet their tomato consumption. The answer is 21.
False: Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, which is twice as much as his girlfriend. So his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 cherry tomatoes a day.
In a week, Steve and his girlfriend eat a total of 6 + 3 = 9 cherry tomatoes a day.
If a vine produces 3 cherry tomatoes a week, then he needs 9 / 3 = 3 vines to keep up with their tomato consumption. 
Therefore, Steve needs 3 vines in order to grow enough cherry tomatoes for their daily consumption.
False: Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, which is twice as much as his girlfriend, so she eats 6/2 = 3 tomatoes a day. In a week, Steve eats 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, so Steve needs 42/3 = 14 vines to meet his tomato consumption. The answer is 14.
21.0 - 4: Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, which is twice as much as his girlfriend. So his girlfriend eats 6/2 = 3 tomatoes a day. This means together they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day. If a vine produces X tomatoes a week, then in 1 day it produces X/7 tomatoes. Steve needs 21 vines, so he needs to be able to produce 21 * (X/7) = 21X/7 = 3X tomatoes a day. This means: \[3X = 9\] \[X = 3\] The answer is 3.
3.0 - 0: Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, which is twice as much as his girlfriend. So his girlfriend eats 6/2 = 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day. Since Steve needs 3 vines, and each vine produces 'X' tomatoes a week, we can write the equation:  Vines * X = Total Tomatoes Eaten 3 * X = 9 * 7 3X = 63 X = 21  Therefore, each vine produces 21 tomatoes a week.
14.0 - 0: Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, which is twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats 6/2 = 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day. If a vine produces X tomatoes a week, then in a day it produces X/7 tomatoes.   Since they need 14 vines to satisfy their daily tomato intake, we can write the following equation: 14 * (X/7) = 9  Solving for X: 14X/7 = 9 2X = 9 X = 9 / 2 X = 4.5  The answer is 4.5.

GT : 276,000
False: Mark bought 12 cars priced at $20,000 each, so the total cost before tax and registration fees is 12 x $20,000 = $240,000.
He paid a 10% tax on these cars, so the tax amount is 10% of $240,000 = $24,000.
The registration fee per car is $1,000, so the total registration fee for all 12 cars is 12 x $1,000 = $12,000.
Therefore, the total amount Mark spent in total is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.
False: Mark bought 12 cars for $20,000 each, so the total cost of the cars is 12 x $20,000 = $240,000.

Q: A band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform consists of a hat, jacket, and trousers, with each hat costing 25 dollars, each jacket costing three times the price of a hat, and each pair of trousers costing the average price of a hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost in total?
GT : 150
True: Let's start by calculating the cost of each item in the uniform. 

- The cost of each hat is $25.
- The cost of each jacket is three times the price of a hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.
- The cost of each pair of trousers is the average price of a hat and jacket, which is (25 + 75) / 2 = $50.

Therefore, the total cost of one uniform (hat + jacket + trousers) is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150. So each uniform costs $150 in total.
True: Let's say the price of a hat is $25. Then the price of a jacket would be 25 * 3 = $75. The average price of a hat and jacket is (25 + 75) / 2 = $50. So the total cost of each uniform (hat, jacket, trousers) would be 25 + 75 + 50 = $150. The answer is $150.
True: To calculate the total cost of each uniform, we need to add the cost of the hat, jacket, and trousers together. 

First, the cost of the jacket is 3 times the cost of the hat, which is 25 dollars. So the jacket costs 3 * 25 = 75 dollars.

Next, the cost of the trousers is the average of the hat and jacket, which is (25 + 75) / 2 = 50 dollars.

Finally, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, jacket, and trousers together: 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 dollars.

Therefore, each uniform costs 150 dollars in total.

Q: Sandra, the owner of a florist shop around the corner, is very dissatisfied with Fred for not completing the order delivery. The number of red roses Sandra ordered is four times the number of white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink lotuses, which is five times the number of white carnations. Sandra threatens to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 PM. How many red roses must Fred deliver before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business?
GT : 160
False: First, let's determine the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. Let's assume the number of white carnations is "x." 

The number of red roses ordered is four times the number of white carnations, so it would be 4x. 
The number of pink lotuses ordered is five times the number of white carnations, so it would be 5x. 

So, the total number of flowers Sandra ordered is x (white carnations) + 4x (red roses) + 5x (pink lotuses) = 10x. 

Given that Sandra ordered a total of 200 pink lotuses, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 and solve for x. 
Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 40. 

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, 160 red roses (4x), and 200 pink lotuses. 

Since Fred didn't deliver the red roses, he needs to deliver 160 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business.
False: Let's start by finding out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, we can represent the number of white carnations as x. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is 4x.

Next, we know that Sandra ordered 200 pink lotuses, which is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of white carnations is also x.

Now, we can set up the equation: x + 4x + 200 = Total number of flowers ordered

Combining like terms, we get 5x + 200 = Total number of flowers ordered

Since the order must include the missing red roses, we need to find out how many red roses are missing. Sandra ordered four times the number of white carnations, which means she ordered 4x red roses. However, Fred did not deliver all the red roses.

To retain Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the missing red roses before 5 PM. Therefore, the number of red roses Fred must deliver is 4x.

By substituting 4x for the missing red roses in the equation 5x + 200, we can find out how many red roses Fred must deliver to retain Sandra's business.
False: Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. 
Sandra ordered four times the number of white carnations in red roses, so she ordered 4x red roses. 
She also ordered 200 pink lotuses, which is five times the number of white carnations, so she ordered 5x pink lotuses. 
The total number of flowers ordered is x + 4x + 5x = 10x. 
Since Sandra threatens to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 PM, Fred must deliver the missing red roses, which is 4x. 
If 4x = the number of red roses to be delivered before 5 PM, then 4x = number of red roses ordered - number of red roses already delivered. 
Therefore, Sandra must deliver 4x red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business.
5.0 - 3: Let's first find the number of white carnations ordered by Sandra. Since the number of red roses Sandra ordered is four times the number of white carnations and the number of pink lotuses is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the following equations:  Let W represent the number of white carnations: Red roses = 4W Pink lotuses = 5W Total flowers = Red roses + White carnations + Pink lotuses = 200 (given)  4W + W + 5W = 200 10W = 200 W = 20  So, Sandra ordered 20 white carnations. Since Fred must deliver 5 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business, X must be before 5 PM.  Therefore, the answer of 'X' is 5 PM.
200.0 - 3: Sandra ordered 4 times the number of white carnations in red roses. She also ordered 5 times the number of white carnations in pink lotuses. If Sandra ordered 200 pink lotuses, then the number of white carnations is 200/5 = 40. So, the number of red roses she ordered is 4 * 40 = 160.  Fred must deliver 200 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business. Therefore, the answer of 'X' is 5 PM.

Q: Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri's score was 10 more than half of Naomi's, and Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?
GT : 54
True:  Let's break down the information given:
- Naomi scored 68 points
- Yuri's score was 10 more than half of Naomi's, so Yuri scored (1/2 * 68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points
- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points
Now we add up the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
The total points scored by the four students is 251, so to find out how many points Jojo scored, we do 251 - 197 = 54 points. 
Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.
True: Let's break down the scores:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is 10 + (68/2) = 10 + 34 = 44 points
- Brianna: 17 more than Naomi's score, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points

So, the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.
Since the total points scored by all 4 students is 251, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points. 
Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.
True: Naomi scored 68 points. Half of Naomi's score is 68 / 2 = 34. So Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. So Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored a total of 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. Therefore, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points. The answer is 54.

GT : 48
False: On Monday, Sati slept 8 hours. The next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 - 2 = 4 hours on each day. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours on each of those days. In total, she slept 8 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 36 hours during the week. The answer is 36.
True: On Monday, Sati slept for 8 hours. The next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept for 8 - 2 = 6 hours on both Tuesday and Wednesday.
For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept for 6 + 1 = 7 hours on each remaining day (Thursday to Sunday).
Therefore, the total hours she slept during the week is 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48 hours. The answer is 48.
False: Sati slept 8 hours on Monday. The next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday and 6 - 2 = 4 hours on Wednesday. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours on Thursday and Friday each. In total, she slept 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 28 hours during the week. The answer is 28.
36.0 - 1: On Tuesday and Wednesday, Sati slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. Let's assume she slept for X hours for the rest of the week. Therefore, the total hours she slept during the week can be represented by the equation: 8 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 6 (Wednesday) + 2X (rest of the week) = 36 20 + 2X = 36 2X = 16 X = 8 So, the answer is 8.
48.0 - 0: On Tuesday and Wednesday, Sati slept for 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. So, for the remaining days of the week, she slept X hours more than these two days.   Therefore, the total hours she slept for the remaining days of the week is X + X = 2X hours.   Given that she slept a total of 48 hours during the week, the equation can be written as:  8 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 6 (Wednesday) + 2X (remaining days) = 48  Solving for X:  8 + 6 + 6 + 2X = 48 20 + 2X = 48 2X = 28 X = 14  Therefore, the answer is that Sati slept 14 hours more than the sum of her sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday.
28.0 - 1: On Monday, Sati slept 8 hours. The next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so on Tuesday she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours, and on Wednesday she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours. That's a total of 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 hours for those three days.  For the rest of the week, she slept X hours more than those two days, so for the rest of the week she slept X + X = 2X hours.  In total, she slept for 18 + 2X = 28 hours during the week.  Solving for X: 18 + 2X = 28 2X = 10 X = 5  Therefore, the answer is 5.

Q: In a room with various toys: 5 red toy cars, 3 toy figures, and a doll. The price of the doll is equivalent to the price of 3 toy figures, and 1 toy car costs $4. If a toy figure costs $5, how much are all the toys worth?
GT : 50
False: The doll is worth the same as 3 toy figures, which cost 5 x $5 = $15 each, and the doll is therefore worth $15.
The 5 red toy cars cost 5 x $4 = $20 in total.
Adding the cost of the doll and the toy cars gives $15 + $20 = $35.
Therefore, all the toys in the room are worth $35.
True: There are 5 red toy cars and each costs $4, so that would be 5 x $4 = $20. 
There are 3 toy figures and each costs $5, so that would be 3 x $5 = $15. 
The doll is equivalent to the price of 3 toy figures, which is $15. 
So, in total, all the toys are worth $20 (toy cars) + $15 (toy figures) + $15 (doll) = $50. The answer is $50.
True: The total cost of the red toy cars is 5 cars * $4 = $20.
The total cost of the toy figures is 3 figures * $5 = $15.
The doll is worth the same as 3 toy figures, so it is also $15.
Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.
35.0 - 2: There are 5 red toy cars, X toy figures, and a doll in the room. The doll's price is equivalent to X toy figures. Given that 1 toy car costs $4 and a toy figure costs $5, the total value of all the toys is $35. Thus, we can write the following equation: <code> 5(4) + X(5) + X = 35  20 + 5X + X = 35  6X = 15  X = 15/6  X ≈ 2.5 </code> Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.5 for X.
50.0 - 6: Let's first determine the price of the doll. Since 1 toy car costs $4, the 5 red toy cars cost 5 x $4 = $20. Since a toy figure costs $5, the value of 'X' toy figures is X x $5 = $5X. The total value of all the toys, including the doll, is $50. So, we can write the following equation: $20 + $5X + $5X = $50 $20 + $10X = $50 $10X = $30 X = 3  Therefore, the answer is that there are 3 toy figures in the room.

Q: The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of a half dozen plates, with each plate priced at $6,000. Calculate the total cost of purchasing each cup.
GT : 145
True: A dozen consists of 12 items, therefore 20 dozen cups consist of 20 x 12 = 240 cups. Let the total cost of purchasing each cup be x dollars.

The total cost of twenty dozen cups is 240x dollars.
The total cost of a half dozen plates is 6,000 x 6 = 36,000 dollars.

According to the information given, 240x = 36,000 - 1,200
240x = 34,800
x = 34,800 / 240
x = 145

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing each cup is $145.
True: First, we need to find the total cost of a half dozen plates. Since each plate is priced at $6,000, a half dozen plates (6 plates) would cost 6 * 6000 = $36,000.

Next, we are told that the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of the plates. So the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1,200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the total number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing each cup is $145.
True: The total cost of a half dozen plates is 6,000 * 6 = 36,000 dollars.
If the total cost of twenty dozen cups is 1,200 dollars less than the total cost of the plates, then the total cost of the cups is 36,000 - 1,200 = 34,800 dollars.
Since there are 20 dozen cups, that means there are 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
Therefore, the cost of purchasing each cup is 34,800 / 240 = 145 dollars.

Q: Jen's makeup artist charges $250 per hour. She is starring in a movie that requires very expensive makeup, needing 6 hours a day, and she has makeup 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to shoot. After the shoot, the makeup artist gives Jen a 10% discount because of the heavy workload. How much does Jen pay?
GT : 27000
True: First, let's calculate the total cost without the discount:
- Jen needs makeup for 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. So, she needs makeup for 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 hours.
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so for 120 hours, the total cost would be 120 * $250 = $30,000.

Next, let's calculate the discount amount:
- The discount is 10% of $30,000, which is 10/100 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Jen pays after the discount:
- After the discount, Jen pays $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Therefore, Jen pays $27,000 in total.
True: First, let's calculate the total cost without the discount. 

Jen needs makeup for 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. So that's 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 hours in total. 

At $250 per hour, the total cost would be 120 * $250 = $30,000. 

Now, with a 10% discount, Jen only needs to pay 90% of the total cost. 

So the discounted amount is $30,000 * 0.90 = $27,000. 

Therefore, Jen pays $27,000 for the makeup artist.
True: Jen needs makeup for 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. So the total number of hours is 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 hours. At $250 per hour, the total cost before the discount is 120 x $250 = $30,000. 
After the 10% discount, Jen pays 90% of the total cost, which is 0.90 x $30,000 = $27,000. 
So Jen pays $27,000 for the makeup artist services.

GT : 5
True: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all four sides. So the perimeter of this park would be 2(1.5) + 2(6) = 3 + 12 = 15 miles. 
If Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, then he would take 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours to complete his walk. 
Therefore, Gary's walk would take 5 hours.
True: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all four sides, so for this park, the perimeter would be 1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6 = 15 miles. 
If Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, then the time it takes for his walk would be 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours. 
Therefore, his walk takes 5 hours.
True: The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides. In this case, the perimeter of the park is 2(1.5) + 2(6) = 3 + 12 = 15 miles. 

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, he will take 15 / 3 = 5 hours to complete his walk. The answer is 5 hours.

Q: Sasha notices that the price of wood has risen by 50% over the past few months. Since she has leftover wood, she decides to sell it. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing her $10. She also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing her $16. How much profit does she make if she sells all of it?
GT : 90
True: For the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber, Sasha has 10 pieces, each costing $10. So the total cost for this type of lumber is 10 * $10 = $100.
For the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber, Sasha has 5 pieces, each costing $16. So the total cost for this type of lumber is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.
If the price of wood has risen by 50%, then Sasha can sell the lumber for 150% of its original cost.
So she can sell the lumber for $180 * 150% = $270.
Her profit would be the selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.
Therefore, Sasha would make a profit of $90 if she sells all the leftover wood.
True: Sasha has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $10, so the total cost for that is 10 x $10 = $100.
She also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $16, so the total cost for that is 5 x $16 = $80.
Therefore, the total cost for all the wood is $100 + $80 = $180.
If the price of wood has risen by 50%, Sasha can sell the wood for 150% of its original cost.
So the selling price would be $180 x 1.5 = $270.
Sasha makes a profit of $270 - $180 = $90 if she sells all of the wood.
True: First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber. Since Sasha has 10 pieces and each piece costs $10, the total cost for the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber is 10 * 10 = $100.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber. Since Sasha has 5 pieces and each piece costs $16, the total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber is 5 * 16 = $80.

Together, the total cost for all the wood Sasha wants to sell is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the price of wood has risen by 50%, Sasha can sell the wood for 150% of its cost, considering a 50% profit margin. Therefore, the total selling price for all the wood is $180 * 1.5 = $270.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price. So, the profit Sasha makes from selling all the wood is $270 - $180 = $90.

GT : 1400
True: The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and baboons need 100 bananas per month. So in total, the zookeeper needs 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month. To last 2 months, he would need to order 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas. The answer is 1400.
True: The total number of bananas needed per month is 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month. To last 2 months, the zookeeper would need to order 700 bananas x 2 = 1400 bananas. The answer is 1400 bananas.
False: The total number of bananas needed per month is 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas. This means for 2 months, he would need to order 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas. The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last 2 months.

GT : 6
True:  Let x be the number of ducks in Jamal's photos.
Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of ducks, she can hold 50x photos.
Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times the number of photos as Brittany's phone, he can hold 6 * 50x = 300x photos.
Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, we have:
300x = 1,800
x = 1,800 / 300
x = 6
Therefore, Jamal photographed 6 ducks at the zoo.
True: If Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos and can hold 6 times the number of photos Brittany's phone can hold, then Brittany's phone can hold 1,800 / 6 = 300 photos. If Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of ducks Jamal photographed at the zoo, then the number of ducks is 300 / 50 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photos from the zoo.

GT : 72
False: Each box has a volume of (5+2) x (6+2) x (4+2) = 7 x 8 x 6 = 336 cubic inches. So the total volume of all 3 boxes is 336 x 3 = 1008 cubic inches. The answer is 1008.
False: Each box has a volume of (5*6*4) = 120 cubic inches. Since the thickness of the box walls is 1 inch, the actual volume of each box is (5-2)*(6-2)*(4-2) = 48 cubic inches. So the total volume of all 3 boxes is 48 * 3 = 144 cubic inches. The answer is 144.
False: Each box has a volume of (5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches) = 120 cubic inches. The thickness of the box walls is 1 inch, so the total volume of each box including the walls is (5 + 2(1)) inches x (6 + 2(1)) inches x (4 + 2(1)) inches = 7 inches x 8 inches x 6 inches = 336 cubic inches. 

Therefore, the total volume of all 3 boxes is 3 x 336 = 1008 cubic inches. The answer is 1008 cubic inches.
1008.0 - 3: Each box measures 5 x X x 4 inches in dimensions, with 1 inch thick walls. So the inner dimensions of each box will be (5-2) x (X-2) x (4-2). The total volume content of all 3 boxes is 1008.0. Therefore, we can write the equation: <code> 3 * (5-2) * (X-2) * (4-2) = 1008  3 * 3 * (X-2) * 2 = 1008  18 * (X-2) = 1008  18X - 36 = 1008  18X = 1044  X = 58 </code>  The answer is 58.
144.0 - 0: Each box has a volume of (5-2X-2)(X-2)(4-2) cubic inches. Since John has 3 boxes, the total volume of all 3 boxes is: 3*(5-2X-2)(X-2)(4-2) = 144.0 Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: (15-6X-6)(X-2)(2) = 144 (9-6X)(X-2) = 72 9X - 2X^2 - 18 + 12 = 72 -2X^2 + 9X - 6 = 72 -2X^2 + 9X - 78 = 0 Using the quadratic formula to solve for X, we get: X = (-9 ± sqrt(9^2 - 4(-2)(-78)))/(2(-2)) X = (-9 ± sqrt(81-624))/(-4) X = (-9 ± sqrt(543))/(-4) Since the thickness of the box walls is 1 inch, we need to choose the positive value for X. Therefore, the answer is the positive root of: X = (-9 + sqrt(543))/(-4) X ≈ 7.55 So, the answer for 'X' is approximately 7.55 inches.

True: Tom started with 50 trees. Every year, he adds 10 trees but also cuts down 2 trees. So after 10 years, he would have added 10 * 10 = 100 trees but also cut down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. So he would have 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees. 
But after 10 years, 30% of the trees have died, so 30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees. So he would have 130 - 39 = 91 trees left. 
The answer is 91.
True:  Tom started with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees added per year. After 10 years, he would have added 8 trees per year for 10 years, so 8 * 10 = 80 total trees added. After 10 years, he would have 50 + 80 = 130 trees. However, 30% of the trees have died, which is 30% of 130, or 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees. So, he would have 130 - 39 = 91 trees left. The answer is 91.
False: Tom started with 50 trees. Every year he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees, so the net gain per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees. After 10 years, he would have gained 8 trees per year * 10 years = 80 trees. 
However, 30% of the trees have died, so 30% of 50 trees is 0.3 * 50 = 15 trees that have died.
Therefore, he would have 80 trees gained - 15 trees died = 65 trees left.

GT : 50
True: Let the number of bags purchased be x. The cost of purchasing x bags at 20 dollars each is 20x. The cost of transporting each bag from the farm to the warehouse is 2 dollars per bag, so the total transportation cost is 2x.

The total cost for the merchant is 20x + 2x = 22x. After selling all the bags at 30 dollars each, the total revenue for the merchant is 30x. The profit is revenue minus cost, so profit = 30x - 22x = 8x.

Given that the merchant gains a total profit of 400 dollars, we can set up the equation 8x = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 50. So the merchant bought and sold 50 bags of wheat.
True: Let's denote the number of bags bought as x. The cost of buying the bags is 20x. The total cost of transporting x bags is 2x. The total cost to the merchant is 20x + 2x = 22x. 

After selling each bag for 30 dollars, the total revenue is 30x. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so profit = 30x - 22x = 8x. We know that the profit is 400 dollars, so 8x = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 50.

Therefore, the merchant sold 50 bags of wheat.
True: Let's calculate the profit per bag first. The cost of each bag was 20 dollars, the transportation cost was 2 dollars, so the total cost per bag was 20 + 2 = 22 dollars. The selling price per bag was 30 dollars. So the profit per bag was 30 - 22 = 8 dollars.

The total profit was 400 dollars. So the total number of bags sold was 400 / 8 = 50 bags. The answer is 50.

Q: Joe's Halloween candy bag contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, how much does Joe's candy bag weigh in grams?
GT : 2600
True: If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, then each candied apple weighs half of that, which is 40 / 2 = 20 grams. 

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams. 
Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams. 

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams. The answer is 2600.

Q: Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards. A month later, she collected three times that amount. In the second month, she collected 20 cards fewer than in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined. How many Pokémon cards does she have now?
GT : 320
False: Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards and then collected 3 times that amount, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards in the first month. In the second month, she collected 20 cards fewer than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards from the first two months, so 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Adding all the cards she collected, Elaine now has 20 + 60 + 40 + 100 = 220 Pokémon cards. The answer is 220.
False: Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected 3 times that amount, so 3 * 20 = 60 cards. In the second month, she collected 20 cards fewer than in the first month, so 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the total of the first and second months, so 2 * (20 + 60 + 40) = 240 cards. So in total, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 240 = 360 Pokémon cards. The answer is 360.
False: Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards. In the second month, she collected 3 times that amount, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards. In the third month, she collected 20 cards less than in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the total from the first two months, which is 2 * (20 + 60) = 160 cards. Adding all the cards together, she now has 20 + 60 + 40 + 160 = 280 Pokémon cards. The answer is 280.
220.0 - 1: Let's break down the information given:  - Elaine initially had X Pokémon cards. - In the first month, she collected 3X cards. - In the second month, she collected 3X - X = 2X cards. - In the third month, she collected 3X + 2X = 5X cards.  Now, we know that the total number of cards she has is 220: X + 3X + 2X + 5X = 220 11X = 220 X = 20  Therefore, the answer is X = 20.
360.0 - 0: Elaine initially had X Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected 3X cards. In the second month, she collected 3X - X = 2X cards. In the third month, she collected 2(3X + 2X) = 10X cards. In total, she now has 360 cards. So, we can write the following equation: X + 3X + 2X + 10X = 360 16X = 360 X = 360 / 16 X = 22.5 Since the number of Pokemon cards must be a whole number, X must be 23.   The answer is 23.
280.0 - 0: Elaine initially had X Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected 3 times that amount, so she had a total of 3X cards. In the second month, she collected X cards fewer than in the first month, so she had 3X - X = 2X cards. In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined, so she collected 2(3X + 2X) = 10X cards. And she has 280 cards in total. <code> X + 3X + 2X + 10X = 280  16X = 280  X = 280 / 16  X = 17.5 </code> Since the number of Pokémon cards cannot be a decimal, it seems there might be a mistake in the calculations or in the way the problem is presented.

Q: Mike used to have 5 pen pals. He no longer corresponds with 2 of them. They each send 2 five-page letters a week. He responds in the same manner. He can write a page in 6 minutes. How many hours per week does he spend writing letters?
GT : 3
True: Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but no longer corresponds with 2 of them, so he now has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
Each of his pen pals sends 2 five-page letters a week, so Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters each week.
Since he responds in the same manner, he also sends 6 letters each week.
If he can write a page in 6 minutes, then he can write a five-page letter in 6 * 5 = 30 minutes.
So, writing 6 five-page letters will take him 6 * 30 = 180 minutes per week.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours per week writing letters. 
The answer is 3 hours.
True: Mike had 5 pen pals originally, but now he only corresponds with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
Each pen pal sends 2 five-page letters a week, so Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 five-page letters.
Since each letter is five pages long, Mike receives 6 * 5 = 30 pages of letters each week.
If he responds in the same manner, he also writes 30 pages of letters each week.
Since he can write a page in 6 minutes, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes writing letters each week.
This is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours per week that Mike spends writing letters.
True: Mike started with 5 pen pals. After no longer corresponding with 2 of them, he is now writing letters to 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals. Each pen pal sends 2 five-page letters a week, so Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. Since he responds in the same manner, he also sends out 6 letters per week. If he can write a page in 6 minutes, then writing a five-page letter would take him 6 * 5 = 30 minutes. Therefore, he spends 30 minutes per letter and 30 * 6 = 180 minutes (or 3 hours) per week writing letters.

Q: Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysat her neighbors' children 4 times, earning $5 each time. She gets $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara had already saved $10 before starting babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes?
GT : 10
False: The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + ($20 * 2) = $70. 
Sara earned $5 each time she babysat, so she has earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting. 
She needs $70 - $20 = $50 more to afford the jacket and shoes. 
She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn $50 / $4 = 12.5 times. 
Since she can't mow the lawn a half time, she will need to mow the lawn 13 times to afford the jacket and shoes.
True: The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is 30 + 20*2 = 30 + 40 = $70. 

Sara earns $5 for each babysitting session, so she earns 5*4 = $20 from babysitting. 

She also earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn. She needs to earn $70 - $20 (from babysitting) = $50 more. 

After saving $10, she still needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40.

She needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times in order to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. 

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times.
True: The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + (2 * $20) = $30 + $40 = $70.
Sara earned $5 for each babysitting job, so she earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
She also earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to earn $70 - $20 - $10 = $40 more.
Since each time she mows the lawn earns her $4, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times. 
So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.
13.0 - 0: Let X be the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so we can write the equation:  <code> X = 30 + 2 * 20 X = 30 + 40 X = 70 </code>  Sara earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. She needs to mow the lawn 13 times to afford the jacket and shoes, so we can write the equation: <code> 5 * 4 + 4 * X = 13 20 + 4X = 13 4X = 13 - 20 4X = -7 X = -7 / 4 X = -1.75 </code>  Since the cost of items cannot be negative, this situation is not possible.
10.0 - 1: Let X be the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The total cost can be calculated as: Jacket = $30 2 pairs of shoes = 2 * $20 = $40  So, X = $30 + $40 = $70  Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, so in 4 babysitting sessions she earns: 4 * $5 = $20  She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. Therefore, the total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is: 10 * $4 = $40  She already saved $10 before starting babysitting, so the total amount she has is: $20 + $40 + $10 = $70  Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara can afford them with the money she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.  Therefore, X = $70.

Q: Jen is 2 years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. If Jean is now 30 years old, how old is Jen now?
GT : 23
True: Jean is 30 years old. Two years ago, she would have been 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Mark was 5 years older than half of that, so he was 28/2 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago. Since Jen is 2 years older than Mark, she would have been 19 + 2 = 21 years old two years ago. Therefore, Jen is now 21 + 2 = 23 years old.
False: If Jean is now 30 years old, half of her age is 30/2 = 15. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 15, so Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago. If Jen is 2 years older than Mark, then Jen is 20 + 2 = 22 years old now.
True: Let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that Jean is 30 years old.

2. Two years ago, Jean was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

3. Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age, which means Mark was 28/2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

4. Jen is 2 years older than Mark, so two years ago Jen was 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

5. Now, two years later, Jen would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Therefore, Jen is now 23 years old.
23.0 - 2: Let's break down the information given: - Jen is 2 years older than Mark, so Mark is 23 - 2 = 21 years old. - Two years ago, Mark was 21 - 2 = 19 years old. - Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age two years ago, so half of Jean's age two years ago is 19 - 5 = 14 years. - Since two years have passed, half of Jean's current age is now 14 + 2 = 16 years. - Therefore, Jean's current age is 16 x 2 = 32 years old.  The answer is 32.
22.0 - 2: Let's first find Mark's age 2 years ago. Since Jen is 2 years older than Mark, Mark's age 2 years ago would be X - 2.   According to the second statement, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age 2 years ago. So, half of Jean's age 2 years ago would be (X - 2)/2.   Therefore, we can write the equation: (X - 2)/2 + 5 = X - 2  Solving this equation, we get: X/2 - 1 + 5 = X - 2 X/2 + 4 = X - 2 X/2 = X - 6 X = 2(X - 6) X = 2X - 12 X = 12  So, Jean is now 12 years old.

GT : 272
True: On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kimo has 3 one-hour classes each day, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.
On Tuesday and Thursday, he has 2 two-hour classes each day, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day, or 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.
So in total, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week in class.
Over a 16-week semester, he spends 17 hours * 16 weeks = 272 hours in class. 
The answer is 272 hours.
True: On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kimo has 3 classes that are one hour long each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day.
On Tuesday and Thursday, Kimo has 2 classes that are two hours long each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day.
In total, Kimo spends 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 17 hours in class per week.
Over a 16-week semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours in class. 
Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours in class over a semester.
True: On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kimo has a total of 3 classes x 1 hour/class = 3 hours per day.
On Tuesday and Thursday, Kimo has a total of 2 classes x 2 hours/class = 4 hours per day.
In a week, he spends 3 days x 3 hours/day + 2 days x 4 hours/day = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week in class.

Q: One aquarium has 4 snails, and another has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in the aquariums. If the number of fish is the same in each aquarium, how many fish are there in each aquarium?
GT : 7
False: Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. The first aquarium has 4 snails, so it has a total of 4 + x animals. The second aquarium has 32 snails, so it has a total of 32 + x animals. 

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish, so we have the equation:

32 - 4 = 2x

28 = 2x
x = 14

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.
False: Let's let x be the number of fish in each aquarium.

So in the first aquarium with 4 snails, there are also x fish.
In the second aquarium with 32 snails, there are also x fish.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish:
32 - 4 = 2x
28 = 2x
x = 14

So there are 14 fish in each aquarium.
False: Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium "x." The first aquarium has 4 snails and x fish. The second aquarium has 32 snails and x fish. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish, so 28 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, each aquarium has 14 fish.

True: To complete 3 crossword puzzles, Carmen would need 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.
To complete 8 Sudoku puzzles, she would need 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.
So in total, Carmen spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend. The answer is 70 minutes.
True: To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles and Sudoku puzzles separately. 

For crossword puzzles:
10 minutes per puzzle x 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

For Sudoku puzzles:
5 minutes per puzzle x 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Total time spent playing games = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing crossword and Sudoku puzzles over the weekend.
True: Carmen needed 10 minutes for each crossword puzzle, so 3 puzzles would take 10 * 3 = 30 minutes. She needed 5 minutes for each Sudoku puzzle, so 8 puzzles would take 5 * 8 = 40 minutes. In total, she spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

How much money does she make that day?
GT : 5
True: On the first day, 5 people come with bicycles, so they need 2 tires inflated each for a total of 5 * 2 = 10 tires inflated for bicycles.
3 people come with tricycles, so they need all 3 tires inflated each for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 tires inflated for tricycles.
Lastly, one person comes with a unicycle, so they need just 1 tire inflated.
In total, Shawnda inflates 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires that day.
Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, Shawnda makes 20 * $0.25 = $5 that day. 
The answer is $5.
True: For the 5 people with bicycles, they each have 2 tires to inflate, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
For the 3 people with tricycles, they each have 3 tires to inflate, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
The person on the unicycle has 1 tire to inflate.
Therefore, there are a total of 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires to inflate.
At 25 cents per tire, Shawnda makes 20 * 0.25 = $5 that day.
True: For the 5 people who came with bicycles, they each had 2 tires to inflate, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.

Q: Three friends spent 20.25 dollars on 3 amusement park tickets. They spent 4.50 dollars less on food than they did on the tickets. They also went on two different rides, each costing 33 dollars. If they agreed to split all the costs equally, how much does each person pay?
GT : 34
False: The total cost of the tickets is 20.25 dollars, so each ticket costs 20.25 / 3 = 6.75 dollars. 
They spent 4.50 dollars less on food, so they spent 6.75 - 4.50 = 2.25 dollars on food each. 
They also spent 33 dollars on each ride, so they spent a total of 33 x 2 = 66 dollars on rides. 
Adding the costs of tickets, food, and rides together, they spent 20.25 + 66 = 86.25 dollars in total. 
If they split the cost equally, each person needs to pay 86.25 / 3 = 28.75 dollars. 
So each person needs to pay 28.75 dollars.
True: The total cost of the tickets is 20.25 dollars, so each ticket costs 20.25 / 3 = 6.75 dollars. They spent 4.50 dollars less on food, so the total spent on food is 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 dollars. Each ride costs 33 dollars and they went on 2 rides, so the total spent on rides is 33 * 2 = 66 dollars. Adding up all the costs, the total amount spent is 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 dollars. Splitting this equally among the 3 friends means each person pays 102 / 3 = 34 dollars. Each person pays 34 dollars.
False:  The total cost of the tickets is 20.25 dollars, so each person pays 20.25 / 3 = 6.75 dollars for the tickets. They spent 4.50 dollars less on food, so they spent 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 dollars on food in total. Each person pays 15.75 / 3 = 5.25 dollars for food. They each also pay 33 dollars for each ride, so they pay 33 * 2 = 66 dollars each for the rides. Adding all the costs together, each person pays 6.75 + 5.25 + 66 = 78 dollars in total. The answer is 78 dollars.
28.75 - 0: The total cost of the tickets was 20.25 dollars. They spent 4.50 dollars less on food, so the total cost of food was 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 dollars. They also spent 33 dollars each on two rides, totaling 33 x 2 = 66 dollars. This means the total cost of all expenses was 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 dollars.  Each person pays 28.75 dollars, so if there are X friends in total, the total payment would be 28.75 x X. Therefore, we can write the equation: 28.75 x X = 102  Solving for X: X = 102 / 28.75 X ≈ 3.54  Since we can't have a fraction of a friend, we must round up, so the answer is 4 friends.
34.0 - 1: Let X be the total cost of the tickets, Y be the total cost of food, and Z be the total cost of rides.   From the given information: 3 friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets, so X = 20.25 They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, so Y = X - 4.50 They went on 2 rides costing $33 each, so Z = 33 * 2  The total cost of everything is X (tickets) + Y (food) + Z (rides). Since they split the cost equally, each person pays $34.  Therefore, X + Y + Z = 3 * 34 (cost per person) Substitute the values of X, Y, and Z into the equation: 20.25 + (20.25 - 4.50) + (33 * 2) = 102  Calculate the total cost: 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 56 + 66 = 102 122 = 102  This is not a valid solution, so there may be a mistake in the calculations or given information.
78.0 - 0: Let's break down the total costs:  - 3 amusement park tickets cost 20.25 dollars each, totaling 20.25 * 3 = 60.75 dollars. - They spent 4.50 dollars less on food, so the total cost of food is 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25 dollars. - They went on two rides, each costing 33 dollars, totaling 33 * 2 = 66 dollars. - So the total cost for everything is 60.75 + 56.25 + 66 = 183 dollars.  Since they agreed to split the costs equally, each person pays 183 / 3 = 61 dollars.  Therefore, the answer is X = 61.

Q: Juliet is on the lake when her boat starts leaking. For every 10 feet she rows towards the shore, the boat takes in 2 liters of water. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. It takes 64 seconds to reach the shore. How much water does the boat take in by the time Juliet reaches the shore?
GT : 16
True: Juliet rows 20 feet, which means the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, so for 20 feet it takes in 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water. Since it takes 64 seconds to reach the shore, and she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, it means she rows 64 / 16 = 4 sets of 20 feet rows. So in total, the boat takes in 4 * 4 = 16 liters of water by the time Juliet reaches the shore. The answer is 16 liters.
True: For every 10 feet, the boat takes in 2 liters of water. Juliet rows 20 feet, so the boat takes in 20/10 * 2 = 4 liters of water. In total, by the time Juliet reaches the shore in 64 seconds, the boat takes in 4 liters of water * 4 intervals = 16 liters of water. The answer is 16 liters.

GT : 32
False: Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish, which totals to 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Roxin caught 5 fewer starfish and 2 fewer seahorses, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish and 6 - 2 = 4 seahorses. Roxin also caught 2 more clownfish, totaling to 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. In total, Anakin and Roxin caught 19 (Anakin's total) + 5 (Roxin's starfish) + 4 (Roxin's seahorses) + 5 (Roxin's clownfish) = 33 fish. The answer is 33.
False: Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish, for a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Roxin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so she caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. She also caught 2 fewer seahorses than Anakin, so she caught 6 - 2 = 4 seahorses. She caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so she caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Q: Sue lives in an interesting neighborhood. One weekend, the neighbors decided to prank Sue. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back a third of the flamingos, painted them white, and then placed these newly painted white flamingos back in Sue's front yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the group. How many more pink plastic flamingos are there than white plastic flamingos on Sunday noon?
GT : 24
True: The neighbors initially placed 18 pink flamingos in Sue's front yard, then took back a third (6) to paint them white, and added another 18 pink flamingos on Sunday. This means that on Sunday, there are 18 pink flamingos + 18 pink flamingos - 6 white flamingos = 30 pink flamingos in total. Since there are only 6 white flamingos, there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday noon. The answer is 24.
True: Initially, Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos in her front yard. On Saturday, her neighbors took back 1/3 of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back in the yard. So now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left. Then on Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos, making the total number of pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30. Since there are 6 white flamingos, there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday noon. The answer is 24.
False: On Friday morning, there were 18 pink flamingos in Sue's yard. On Saturday morning, a third of them (18/3 = 6) were taken back and painted white, so there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left. Then, 6 white flamingos were added, making a total of 12 + 6 = 18 white flamingos on Sunday morning. The neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos on Sunday, so there were a total of 18 + 18 = 36 pink flamingos. Therefore, there are 36 - 18 = 18 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday noon. The answer is 18.
24.0 - 2: Let's break down the information given in the question:  - On Friday morning, there were X pink plastic flamingos placed in Sue's front yard. - On Saturday morning, a third of the flamingos were taken back, painted white, and placed back in the yard. So, (1/3)X flamingos were painted white and added back. - On Sunday morning, another X pink plastic flamingos were added to the group.  The total number of pink plastic flamingos on Sunday at noon is equal to the original number of pink flamingos (X) minus the third that were painted white and added back, plus the additional X added on Sunday. This total is 24 more than the number of white flamingos added back.  So, the equation we can write is: X - (1/3)X + X = 24  Solving for X: 2X - (1/3)X = 24 (6/3)X - (1/3)X = 24 (5/3)X = 24 X = 24 * (3/5) X = 72 / 5 X = 14.4  Since you can't have a fraction of a plastic flamingo, we round down to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, the answer is X = 14.
18.0 - 1: Let's break down the problem: - On Friday, the neighbors placed X pink flamingos in Sue's front yard. - On Saturday, they took back (1/3)X flamingos, painted them white, and placed them back. - So on Saturday, there are (2/3)X pink flamingos and (1/3)X white flamingos. - On Sunday, they added another X pink flamingos, making the total number of pink flamingos as (2/3)X + X. - Given that there are 18 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday, we can write the following equation: (2/3)X + X = (1/3)X + 18  Solving for X: (2/3)X + X = (1/3)X + 18 5/3 X = 1/3 X + 18 4/3 X = 18 X = 18 * 3 / 4 X = 13.5  Since we can't have half a flamingo, we can conclude that the initial number of pink flamingos placed in Sue's front yard on Friday was 13.

GT : 5
True: To make 1 Spanish fruit pie, Sandra needs 3 eggs. To make 15 Spanish fruit pies, she will need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs in total. Each time Sandra babysits, she receives a basket of 9 eggs. So, Sandra needs to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times in order to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish fruit pies. The answer is 5.
True: To make 1 Spanish fruit pie, Sandra needs 3 eggs. To make 15 pies, she would need 3 x 15 = 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, Sandra would need to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times in order to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish fruit pies. The answer is 5.
True: To make 15 Spanish fruit pies, Sandra needs 15 pies x 3 eggs = 45 eggs in total. Since she gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, she must babysit 45 eggs / 9 eggs per basket = 5 times. So Sandra must babysit 5 times.

Q: Seth is twice the age of Brooke. In two years, their combined age will be 28 years. How old is Seth this year?
GT : 16
True: Let x be the age of Brooke. So, Seth's age is 2x. In two years, their combined age will be x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28. Simplifying, we get 3x + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 3x = 24. Divide by 3 to get x = 8. So, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old this year.
True: Let's represent Brooke's age as B and Seth's age as S. Since Seth is twice the age of Brooke, we can write the equation S = 2B. In two years, their combined age will be 28, so we can also write the equation (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28.

Substitute S = 2B into the second equation: B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28
Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24
Divide by 3: B = 8

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, we know that S = 2(8) = 16. Therefore, Seth is 16 years old this year.
True: Let's use the information given. Seth is twice the age of Brooke, so if Brooke is x years old, then Seth is 2x years old. In two years, their combined age will be 28, so (x+2) + (2x+2) = 28. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 4 = 28. 
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3x = 24. 
Dividing by 3, we get x = 8. 

So, Brooke is 8 years old, and Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old. Since we are looking for Seth's age this year, Seth is currently 16 years old.

If Zaid earns 6,000 dollars a month, how much money does he have left after paying all these expenses and making donations?
GT : 350
True: Zaid earns 6,000 dollars a month. 1/4 of that is used for rent, which is 6,000 / 4 = 1,500 dollars. 1/3 is for gas, which is 6,000 / 3 = 2,000 dollars. So the total used for rent and gas is 1,500 + 2,000 = 3,500 dollars.
After paying for rent and gas, Zaid has 6,000 - 3,500 = 2,500 dollars left. Half of that goes to charity, which is 2,500 / 2 = 1,250 dollars.
After donating to charity, Zaid has 2,500 - 1,250 = 1,250 dollars left. He gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, which is a total of 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.
Finally, after giving his daughter and wife their allowances, Zaid has 1,250 - 900 = 350 dollars left. So, he has 350 dollars left after paying all expenses and making donations.
True: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500 dollars.
He spends 1/3 of his salary on gas, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars.
After paying for rent and gas, he has 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars left.
He gives half of the remaining salary to charity, which is 2500 / 2 = 1250 dollars.
After donating to charity, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left.
He gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, which is 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Q: A watermelon farm produced 120 small watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm two months later and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be picked, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, three-quarters of the remaining melons were ripe, so she picked them all. How many melons were not ripe after these two weeks?
GT : 21
True: Ashlyn found that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready to be picked, which is 120 * 0.30 = 36 watermelons. After she took these home, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left. After two weeks, three-quarters of these remaining watermelons were ripe, which is 84 * 0.75 = 63 watermelons. So, the number of watermelons that were not ripe after these two weeks is 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons. The answer is 21.
True: First, 30% of 120 small watermelons is 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons ready to be picked by Ashlyn. After she picked them, there were 120 - 36 = 84 melons remaining. 
Then, three-quarters of the remaining 84 melons were ripe, which means 3/4 * 84 = 63 melons were picked by Ashlyn. 
Therefore, the number of melons not ripe after these two weeks is 84 - 63 = 21. The answer is 21.
True: Out of the 120 small watermelons produced, 30% were ready to be picked initially, which is 120 * 0.30 = 36 watermelons. So after Ashlyn picked these, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.
Out of these 84 watermelons, three-quarters were ripe after two weeks, which is 84 * 0.75 = 63 watermelons. So Ashlyn picked these as well, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons that were not ripe after two weeks.

True: The customs officer originally had 2 containers with 5 bicycles each, so a total of 2 x 5 = 10 bicycles. The next day, the total number of bicycles increased to 30, so there were 30 - 10 = 20 bicycles in the new containers. Since each container holds 5 bicycles, the number of containers imported the next day would be 20 / 5 = 4. The answer is 4.
True: There were originally 2 containers with 5 bicycles each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 bicycles. After the next day, there were a total of 30 bicycles, so the additional containers must have brought in 30 - 10 = 20 more bicycles. Since each container holds 5 bicycles, there must have been 20 / 5 = 4 containers imported the next day. The answer is 4.
True: The customs officer counted 2 containers, each containing 5 bicycles, so initially there were 2 * 5 = 10 bicycles. With the arrival of more containers, the total number of bicycles became 30. So, the additional containers brought in 30 - 10 = 20 bicycles. Since each container holds 5 bicycles, the number of containers imported the next day is 20 / 5 = 4. The answer is 4.

Q: Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, and Fred rode it four times. Afterwards, they each decided to ride the sled twice. If each ride requires 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?
GT : 60
True:  Pam rode the roller coaster twice, which is 2 rides x 6 tickets = 12 tickets. Fred rode the roller coaster four times, which is 4 rides x 6 tickets = 24 tickets. Then they each rode the sled twice, which is 2 rides x 2 people x 6 tickets = 24 tickets. In total, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets that day. The answer is 60.
True: Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so that's 2 rides x 6 tickets = 12 tickets. Fred rode the roller coaster four times, so that's 4 rides x 6 tickets = 24 tickets. Together, they used 12 tickets + 24 tickets = 36 tickets on the roller coaster. Then they each rode the sled twice, so that's 2 rides x 2 people x 6 tickets = 24 tickets. In total, they used 36 tickets + 24 tickets = 60 tickets that day.
False: Pam rode the roller coaster twice, which is 2 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets. Fred rode the roller coaster four times, which is 4 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 24 tickets. Then they each rode the sled twice, which is 2 rides x 2 people x 2 tickets per ride = 8 tickets. In total, they used 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 tickets that day.
60.0 - 3: Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. Then, they both rode the sled twice each. So, the total number of tickets used can be calculated as: (2 + 4) + (2 + 2) = 10 tickets used Given that they used 60 tickets in total, we can write the equation: 10X = 60 X = 60 / 10 X = 6  Therefore, the answer is 6 tickets for each ride.
44.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given: - Pam rode the roller coaster twice, which would be 2*X tickets. - Fred rode the roller coaster four times, which would be 4*X tickets. - They each then rode the sled twice, which would be 2*X tickets each, totaling 4*X tickets. - In total, they used 44 tickets that day. Putting all together, we get the equation: 2*X + 4*X + 4*X = 44 10*X = 44 X = 44/10 X = 4.4 So, the answer is 4.4 tickets.

Q: Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve, who lives farther, is allowed to ride a bike. Steve's place is 3 miles from school, and he rides at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim's place is 2 miles from school. If Tim can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?
GT : 4
True: Let's start by converting the distances to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to reach home. Steve's time is distance/speed, so 15840/440 = 36 minutes. Tim's time is 10560/264 = 40 minutes.

Since Tim takes longer, the winner, Steve, will wait for Tim to finish the race. Therefore, Steve will wait 40 - 36 = 4 minutes at home before Tim finishes the race. The answer is 4 minutes.
True:  To find out how long the winner will wait at home before the loser finishes the race, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach home.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equal to 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.
Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equal to 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Steve's time = distance / speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.
Tim's time = distance / speed = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Tim takes longer, Steve will wait for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes at home before Tim finishes the race. So, the winner will wait for 4 minutes.
True: First, let's convert the distances to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we can find the time it takes for each person to reach home:
- Steve's time = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet/min = 36 minutes
- Tim's time = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet/min = 40 minutes

Since Steve arrives home first, Tim will have to wait for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

Q: Katie brews coffee at a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water. If the total amount of sugar and water she used equals 120 teaspoons and cups, calculate how many teaspoons of sugar she used.
GT : 42
True: First, let's find the total parts in the ratio. 7 teaspoons of sugar + 13 cups of water = 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Next, we can calculate the number of parts that one unit represents. 120 total teaspoons and cups / 20 total parts = 6 teaspoons per part.

Finally, to find the amount of sugar used, we can multiply the number of parts for sugar by the amount per part: 7 parts of sugar * 6 teaspoons per part = 42 teaspoons of sugar used. 

So, Katie used 42 teaspoons of sugar.
False: The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar used. The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons and cups. So, 7x + 13(120-x) = 120. Solving for x, we get 7x + 1560 - 13x = 120. Rearranging, we get -6x = -1440. Dividing by -6, we get x = 240. Katie used 240 teaspoons of sugar.
True: Katie brews coffee at a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water. Let's say she used x teaspoons of sugar, then she used 120 - x cups of water. According to the ratio, we have the equation:

7/13 = x/(120 - x)

After cross multiplication and simplification, we get:

13x = 840 - 7x
20x = 840
x = 42

Therefore, Katie used 42 teaspoons of sugar.
42.0 - 0: The ratio of sugar to water is 7 teaspoons to 13 cups. So, if she used X total teaspoons and cups, we can set up the following equation: 7/13 = X/2. The total amount of sugar and water she used equals 42.0 teaspoons and cups. So, X = 42. Therefore, 7/13 = 42/2, which simplifies to 7 = 21. The answer is 21.
240.0 - 0: To find the total amount of sugar and water Katie used, we need to calculate the total ratio of sugar to water first. The ratio given is 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 teaspoon of sugar to approximately 1.86 cups of water.  Since the total teaspoons of sugar in 240 cups of water is 240 * 7/13, we can calculate the total teaspoons of sugar used by Katie: ```  Total teaspoons of sugar = 240 * 7/13 = 128.57 (approximately) ``` Therefore, the answer to 'X' is 240 as stated in the question.

Q: Blake and Kelly have a contest to see who can run the farthest in 15 minutes. They decide to race on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?
GT : 80
False: To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we first need to calculate the distance each person ran.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field, so he ran a total of 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, so she ran a total of 34 * 2 * 40 = 2720 yards.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the distance Kelly ran from the distance Blake ran: 3000 - 2720 = 280 yards.

Therefore, the winner ran 280 yards farther than the loser.
False: Blake runs 100 yards back and forth 15 times, so he runs 100 * 2 * 15 = 3000 yards.
Kelly runs 40 yards back and forth 34 times, so she runs 40 * 2 * 34 = 2720 yards.
The difference in distance run is 3000 - 2720 = 280 yards. So the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser.
False: Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, covering 15 x 100 = 1500 yards. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line 34 times, covering 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. 
So, the winner (Kelly) runs 2720 - 1500 = 1220 yards farther than the loser (Blake). The answer is 1220 yards.
280.0 - 3: Let's break down the information given: - Blake runs back and forth X times on a 100-yard field. - Kelly runs back and forth once on a 100-yard field, then decides to run to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.  To find the total distance each person ran: - Blake: 100 yards * 2 (back and forth) * X times - Kelly: (100 yards * 2) + (40 yards * 2 * 34)   We are given that the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser, so their total distances should differ by 280 yards: 100 * 2 * X = (100 * 2) + (40 * 2 * 34) + 280 200X = 200 + 2720 + 280 200X = 3200 X = 16  Therefore, the answer is X = 16.
1220.0 - 0: Let's denote the distance Blake runs back and forth 'X' times as B and the distance Kelly runs back and forth once as K.  We know that B = 200*X (since Blake runs back and forth 'X' times on a 100-yard football field) and K = 200 (since Kelly runs back and forth once on a 100-yard football field).  We also know that K = 80*34 (since Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times).  The difference in distance run by the winner and loser is given as 1220.0. Therefore, we have:  B - K = 1220.0  Substitute the values of B and K into the equation:  200*X - 80*34 = 1220.0 200*X - 2720 = 1220.0 200*X = 3940 X = 3940 / 200 X = 19.7  Therefore, the value of 'X' is 19.7.

Q: John spends $2 on milk, $3 on eggs, $3 on light bulbs, $3 on cups, and $4 on a cockroach trap. If all non-food items are subject to a 10% tax, how much does everything cost?
GT : 16
True: John spends $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 on the items. Since only non-food items are subject to a 10% tax, the total tax would be 10% of $10 ($3 + $3 + $3 + $4) which is $1. So, the total cost would be $15 + $1 = $16. The answer is $16.
False:  John spent a total of $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 on non-food items. With a 10% tax on non-food items, the tax amount is 10% of $15, which is $15 * 10/100 = $1.50. Therefore, everything costs $15 + $1.50 = $16.50. The answer is $16.50.
False: John spends a total of $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 on items. Since only non-food items are subject to a 10% tax, the total tax amount is $3 ($3 + $3 + $3) * 0.1 = $0.30. Adding the tax to the total amount spent, the total cost is $15 + $0.30 = $15.30. The answer is $15.30.
16.0 - 0: Let's break it down:  John spends $2 on milk, $X on eggs, $X on light bulbs, $X on cups, and $4 on a cockroach trap.   Subtotal without tax:  2 + X + X + X + 4 = 16  Combine like terms: 2 + 4 + 3X = 16 6 + 3X = 16  Subtract 6 from both sides: 3X = 10  Divide by 3: X = 10/3 X = 3.33  So, the answer for 'X' is 3.33.
16.5 - 2: Let's denote the cost of eggs, light bulbs, and cups as X.   The total cost without tax can be written as: 2 (milk) + X (eggs) + X (light bulbs) + X (cups) + 4 (cockroach trap)  Adding the 10% tax on non-food items, the total cost becomes: 2 + X + X + X + 4 + 0.1(3X) = 16.5 Simplifying, we get: 2 + 3X + 0.3X + 4 = 16.5 7 + 3.3X = 16.5 3.3X = 9.5 X = 9.5 / 3.3 X ≈ 2.88  Therefore, the cost of eggs, light bulbs, and cups is approximately $2.88.
15.3 - 0: Let's break down the expenses: - Milk: $2 - Eggs: $X - Light bulbs: $X - Cups: $X - Cockroach trap: $4  Total non-food items cost: $X + $X + $X + $4 = $3X + $4 10% tax on non-food items: 10% of ($3X + $4) = 0.1($3X + $4) = 0.3X + 0.4  Total cost of everything: $2 + $X + $X + $X + $4 + (0.3X + 0.4) = 15.3  Combining all the costs: $2 + 3X + $4 + 0.3X + 0.4 = 15.3 3X + $6.4 = 15.3 3X = 8.9 X = 2.966666667  The answer for 'X' is approximately 2.97.

Q: Billy is peeling and chopping potatoes, preparing to make potato salad for his large family reunion barbecue. This is a grand event, so he has to prepare 60 potatoes. The potatoes are roughly the same size, and it takes about the same time to peel and chop each potato. Billy takes about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to chop a potato. How long does it take Billy to prepare these potatoes?
GT : 95
False: To prepare 60 potatoes, Billy will spend 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) peeling each potato and 5 seconds chopping each potato. 
So, to peel all 60 potatoes, Billy will spend 90 seconds x 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds. 
And to chop all 60 potatoes, he will spend 5 seconds x 60 potatoes = 300 seconds. 
Adding these times together, Billy will spend a total of 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds preparing the potatoes. 
Therefore, it will take Billy 5700 seconds (or 95 minutes) to prepare the 60 potatoes.
True: Billy needs to prepare 60 potatoes. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and 5 seconds to chop each potato. To calculate the total time it takes him, we first need to convert the time it takes to chop a potato into minutes. Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, 5 seconds is 5/60 = 1/12 minute. 

For peeling the potatoes:
1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

For chopping the potatoes:
1/12 minute * 60 potatoes = 5 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes Billy to prepare these potatoes is 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (chopping) = 95 minutes.
False: To peel 60 potatoes at 1.5 minutes each, it would take Billy 60 * 1.5 = 90 minutes to peel all the potatoes. 

To chop 60 potatoes at 5 seconds each, it would take Billy 60 * 5/60 = 5 minutes to chop all the potatoes. 

So in total, it would take Billy 90 minutes to peel the potatoes and 5 minutes to chop the potatoes, making a total of 90 + 5 = 95 minutes to prepare all the potatoes. 

Therefore, it would take Billy 95 minutes to prepare the 60 potatoes for the family reunion barbecue.
60.0 - 0: Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. Let's denote the time he takes to chop a potato as X seconds.   Since it takes him 60 minutes to prepare 60 potatoes, we can set up the following equation: 1.5 minutes per potato (peeling) + X seconds per potato (chopping) = 60 minutes  Since we need the time in the same units, we can convert minutes to seconds: 1.5 minutes = 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds  So the equation becomes: 90 seconds + X seconds = 60 minutes * 60 seconds/minute 90 + X = 3600 X = 3600 - 90 X = 3510  Therefore, it takes Billy 3510 seconds to chop a potato.
95.0 - 4: To find the value of X, we need to first determine how much time it takes Billy to peel all the potatoes and how much time it takes him to chop all the potatoes.  Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and there are 60 potatoes, so: Time to peel potatoes = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes  Billy takes X seconds to chop one potato and there are 60 potatoes, so: Time to chop potatoes = (X/60) seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = X seconds  Total time taken = Time to peel + Time to chop = 90 minutes + X seconds  Given that total time taken is 95.0 minutes, we can write the equation: 90 minutes + (X seconds)/60 = 95.0 minutes Dividing by 60 to convert seconds to minutes: 90 minutes + X/60 minutes = 95.0 minutes X/60 = 95.0 - 90 X/60 = 5.0 X = 5.0 * 60 X = 300  Therefore, X = 300 seconds.

On Wednesday, he watched several episodes, each lasting 30 minutes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one episode lasting 1 hour and one episode lasting 30 minutes. On Friday, since it was the weekend, he was allowed to stay up late and watched two episodes, each lasting 1 hour. If he watched a total of 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?
GT : 3
True: On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night for a total of 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched 2 episodes x 1 hour each = 2 hours.
Adding up all the time he watched TV, he watched a total of 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.
Since he watched a total of 7 hours, he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.
Since each episode on Wednesday lasted 30 minutes, he must have watched 1.5 hours / 0.5 = 3 episodes.
Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.
True: Frankie watched 2 episodes on Monday and Tuesday, each lasting 1 hour, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 hours.
Then on Thursday, he watched 1 episode lasting 1 hour and 1 episode lasting 30 minutes, so that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched 2 episodes, each lasting 1 hour, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 hours.
Adding all these up, Frankie watched a total of 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.
Since he watched a total of 7 hours, he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.
Since each episode on Wednesday lasted 30 minutes, he must have watched 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes. 
The answer is 3.
False: Frankie watched 1 episode each on Monday and Tuesday, 2 episodes on Thursday, and 2 episodes on Friday, each lasting 1 hour, for a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 hours.
He also watched several episodes on Wednesday, each lasting 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, he watched 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 hours of TV before Wednesday.
Since he watched a total of 7 hours, this means he watched 7 - 6.5 = 0.5 hours on Wednesday.
Since each episode lasting 30 minutes, he watched 0.5 / 0.5 = 1 episode on Wednesday.
Therefore, Frankie watched 1 episode of his favorite show on Wednesday.
3.0 - 3: Let's break down the total hours of TV watched each day:  - Monday: 1 episode * X hours = X hours - Tuesday: 1 episode * X hours = X hours - Wednesday: 3 episodes * 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours - Thursday: 1 episode * X hours + 1 episode * 0.5 hours = X + 0.5 hours - Friday: 2 episodes * X hours = 2X hours  Adding all these up, we get: X + X + 1.5 + X + 0.5 + 2X = 7 5X + 2 = 7 5X = 5 X = 1  Therefore, the answer is X = 1.
1.0 - 0: Let's break down each day:  - Monday: 1 episode of X hours - Tuesday: 1 episode of X hours - Wednesday: Several episodes of 30 minutes each, which is equal to 0.5X - Thursday: 1 episode of X hours + 1 episode of 0.5 hours - Friday: 2 episodes of X hours  Putting it all together: 1X + 1X + 0.5X + 1X + 0.5 + 2X = 7  Simplifying the equation: 5.5X = 6.5 X = 6.5 / 5.5 X = 1.18  Therefore, the answer is X = 1.18.

Q: Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Jinje gave Griffin some of her fries, and then Colby took 3 less than Kyle did from Griffin. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, how many fries did Jinje give to Griffin?
GT : 20
False: Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 5 x 2 = 10 fries. After Billy took his fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left. 
Jinje gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than Kyle did. Let's say Jinje gave Griffin X fries. After Jinje gave Griffin X fries, Griffin had 9 + X fries. Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffin. 
After Colby took his fries, Griffin had 9 + X - 2 = 27 fries left. This means 9 + X = 27. Solving for X, we get X = 27 - 9 = 18. Jinje gave Griffin 18 fries.
False: Let's break it down step by step:

- Griffin had 24 fries
- Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 left
- Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 * 5 = 10
- After Billy took 10, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left
- Jinje gave Griffin some fries, so let's say she gave x fries
- After Jinje gave fries to Griffin, he had 9 + x fries
- Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries
- After all this, Griffin had 27 fries, so 9 + x = 27
- Solving for x, we get x = 18
Therefore, Jinje gave Griffin 18 fries.
False: If Griffin started with 24 fries, Kyle took 5, leaving 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
After Billy took his fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
Jinje gave some of her fries to Griffin, and then Colby took 3 less than Kyle did.
If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, this means Jinje gave him 27 - 9 = 18 fries.
Therefore, Jinje gave Griffin 18 fries.

Q: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% every two months, how much does a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?
GT : 92
False: The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months. After 36 months, this means the price has increased 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase). 

The price of the bag of marbles after 36 months can be calculated as follows:
$20 * (1 + 0.20)^18 = $20 * (1.20)^18 ≈ $20 * 9.572 = $191.44

Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $191.44 after 36 months.
False: If the bag of marbles costs $20 initially and increases by 20% every two months, after 36 months there would have been 36/2 = 18 two-month periods.
Every two months, the price increases by 20%, so after 18 periods the price would be increased by (1.20)^18 = 43.823.
Therefore, after 36 months, the cost of a bag of marbles would be 20 * 43.823 = $876.46.
False: If the price increases by 20% every two months, it means the price will be multiplied by 1.20 every two months. After 36 months (which is 18 two-month periods), the price will be multiplied by (1.20)^18 = 6.191736 to calculate the final price. 

So the final price of a bag of marbles after 36 months will be 20 * 6.191736 = $123.83. The answer is $123.83.
36.0 - 0: Let's assume the original cost of the bag of marbles is X dollars. After every 2 months, the price increases by 20%, which means it becomes 1.2 times the previous price. After 36 months, the cost is 36 dollars. We can set up the following equation:  X * (1.2)^18 = 36  Solving for X:  X = 36 / (1.2)^18 X = 36 / 5.159  X ≈ 6.97  So, the original cost of the bag of marbles is approximately $6.97.
876.46 - 0: Let's denote the original cost of the bag of marbles as X. After every two months, the price increases by 20%, which means it will be multiplied by 1.20 each time.  After 36 months, the price will have increased 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase). So, the final cost of the bag of marbles can be calculated as:  X * (1.20)^18 = 876.46  Solving for X:  X = 876.46 / (1.20)^18 X ≈ 25.00  Therefore, the original cost of the bag of marbles was $25.00.
123.83 - 1: Let's denote the original cost of a bag of marbles as X. After 36 months, the price would have increased 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase), resulting in a total increase of 20% * 18 = 360%.  The final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months can be calculated as: Final cost = X + 360% of X = X + 3.6X = 4.6X  Given that the final cost is $123.83, we can write the equation: 4.6X = 123.83 X = 123.83 / 4.6 X ≈ 26.91  Therefore, the answer is X ≈ 26.91, so the original cost of a bag of marbles was approximately $26.91.

Q: Will's mom sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. The price of a watermelon is three times the price of a pepper. The price of an orange is $5 less than the price of a watermelon. Dylan was sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. If each pepper costs $15, how much did he spend in total?
GT : 880
True: First, we need to determine the prices of the watermelon and orange. Since the price of a watermelon is three times the price of a pepper, and each pepper costs $15, the price of a watermelon is 3 * 15 = $45. 

The price of an orange is $5 less than the price of a watermelon, so it is 45 - 5 = $40. 

Dylan bought 4 watermelons at $45 each, totaling 4 * 45 = $180. 
He also bought 20 peppers at $15 each, totaling 20 * 15 = $300. 
And he bought 10 oranges at $40 each, totaling 10 * 40 = $400. 

Therefore, Dylan spent a total of 180 + 300 + 400 = $880 at the store.
True: First, we need to determine the price of a watermelon. Since the price of a watermelon is three times the price of a pepper, a watermelon costs $15 x 3 = $45.
Next, we need to find the price of an orange. The price of an orange is $5 less than the price of a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.
Dylan bought 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total cost of the watermelons is 4 x $45 = $180.
The total cost of the peppers is 20 x $15 = $300. And the total cost of the oranges is 10 x $40 = $400.
Therefore, Dylan spent $180 + $300 + $400 = $880 in total.
True: First, we need to determine the prices of the watermelon and orange. Since the price of a pepper is $15, then the price of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45. And the price of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, Dylan bought 4 watermelons at $45 each, so he spent 4 * $45 = $180 on watermelons. 
He also bought 20 peppers at $15 each, so he spent 20 * $15 = $300 on peppers.
And he bought 10 oranges at $40 each, so he spent 10 * $40 = $400 on oranges.

Therefore, in total, Dylan spent $180 + $300 + $400 = $880 at the store.
