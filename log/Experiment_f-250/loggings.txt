Q: Jenny helps in her mom's office. She has a stack of 60 letters that need stamps and a stack of letters that already have stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the stack that already have stamps, how many letters were in that stack when Jenny started stamping?
GT : 10
False: When Jenny started stamping, there were 90 letters total in the two stacks (60 needing stamps + 30 already stamped). Since one-third of the letters needing stamps now have stamps, that means she put stamps on 20 of the letters needing stamps (60 / 3 = 20). Therefore, there were 40 letters in the stack needing stamps when Jenny started stamping.
False: Let's call the total number of letters that Jenny started with as x.

Jenny puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters that need stamps, which is (1/3)*60 = 20 letters.

After putting stamps on these letters, there are now 30 letters with stamps, leaving 40 letters without stamps.

Therefore, the total number of letters at the beginning was x = 40 (letters without stamps) + 30 (letters with stamps) = 70 letters.
False: When Jenny started, there were 60 letters that needed stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of them, which is 60/3 = 20 letters.

So, out of the 60 letters, she put stamps on 20 of them, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 letters still needing stamps.

If there are now 30 letters in the stack that already have stamps, this means she stamped 60 - 30 = 30 letters.

Since Jenny put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can say that the 30 letters she stamped represent one-third of the total letters needing stamps. This means there were 30 * 3 = 90 letters in total when Jenny started stamping.
40.0 - 0: Jenny started with 60 letters needing stamps. She put stamps on one-third of them, which is 60/3 = 20 letters. So, there were 40 - 20 = 20 letters in the stack that already had stamps. Therefore, the answer is X = 20.
70.0 - 3: Jenny started with 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on 1/3 of them, which means she put stamps on 60 / 3 = 20 letters. So, the stack of letters needing stamps now has 60 - 20 = 40 letters. If there were 70 letters in the stack that already have stamps when Jenny started, then the total number of letters is 70 + X. Therefore, the equation would be: X + 40 = 70 + X 40 = 70 X = 30  So, the answer is 30.
90.0 - 1: When Jenny started, there were 60 letters needing stamps and X letters already stamped, making a total of 60 + X letters. After stamping one-third of the letters needing stamps, there were 90 letters already stamped. This means that 1/3 of the 60 letters were stamped, which is 60/3 = 20 letters. So, the total number of letters is 90 when Jenny started stamping.   Therefore, we can write the following equation: <code> 60 + X = 90  X = 90 - 60  X = 30 </code>  The answer is 30.

Q: Mark is a copy editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, and they each pay him a different price per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences a week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How many cents does Mark earn per week?
GT : 7500
True: Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence (twice as much as Publisher A). Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A (an equal number) and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week, so he earns (500 * 5 cents) + (500 * 10 cents) = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents per week. 
Therefore, Mark earns 7500 cents per week.
False: Let x be the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A each week.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits x sentences for Publisher B as well.

Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays 5 cents x 2 = 10 cents per sentence.
Publisher B pays Mark 10x cents per week for editing for them.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences a week, so:
x + x = 1000
2x = 1000
x = 500

Thus, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so Publisher A pays Mark 5 * 500 = 2500 cents per week.
Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence, so Publisher B pays Mark 10 * 500 = 5000 cents per week.

Therefore, Mark earns 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents per week or $75.00.
False: Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so Publisher B pays him 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
Mark edits 1,000 sentences a week, so he earns 5 * 1000 = 5000 cents per week from Publisher A.
Mark also edits 1,000 sentences a week for Publisher B, earning 10 * 1000 = 10000 cents per week from Publisher B.
Therefore, Mark earns a total of 5000 + 10000 = 15000 cents per week.
7500.0 - 1: Let the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A be denoted as X. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B is also X.  Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, so if Publisher A pays X cents per sentence, then Publisher B pays 2X cents per sentence.  The total number of sentences Mark edits per week is 1000, so we can write the equation: X + 2X = 1000 3X = 1000 X = 1000 / 3 X = 333.33  Since we can't have a fraction of a sentence, we can round X to the nearest whole number: X = 333  Publisher A pays Mark 333 cents per sentence, and Mark earns 7500 cents per week, so we can write the equation: 333 * 1000 = 7500 333000 = 7500 The equation is incorrect, please check your inputs and try again.
75.0 - 0: Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as A and B. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we have:  A = B  Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, so we have:  B = 2A  Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences a week, so:  A + B = 1000  Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:  A + 2A = 1000 3A = 1000 A = 1000 / 3 A = 333.33  Therefore, Publisher A pays Mark 333.33 cents per sentence.
15000.0 - 0: Let's assume Mark edits 'Y' sentences for Publisher A and 'Y' sentences for Publisher B each week. Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is Y * X cents and the total amount he earns from Publisher B is Y * 2*X cents.  Given that Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences a week, we have Y + Y = 1000, which simplifies to 2Y = 1000. Therefore, Y = 500.  Mark earns 15,000 cents per week, so we can write the equation: 500 * X + 500 * 2X = 15000 500X + 1000X = 15000 1500X = 15000 X = 15000 / 1500 X = 10  Therefore, Publisher A pays Mark 10 cents per sentence.

Q: Dave bought a large pack of fries before a hungry seagull stole the pack from his hands after he had eaten 14 fries. When the seagull landed, it devoured half the amount of fries Dave had eaten. Then 3 pigeons chased it away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries. How many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?
GT : 48
False: Let x be the original number of fries in the pack.

After Dave ate 14 fries, there were x - 14 fries left.
The seagull ate half of the fries Dave had eaten, so there were (x - 14) - (14 / 2) = x - 21 fries left.
After the pigeons ate 3 fries each, there were x - 21 - (3 * 3) = x - 30 fries left.
The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the fries, so there were (1/3)(x - 30) = 5 fries left.

(1/3)(x - 30) = 5
x - 30 = 15
x = 45

There were 45 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.
False: Dave initially had 14 fries left from the pack before the seagull stole it. The seagull ate half of 14, which is 7 fries. So, there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries in the pack before the seagull landed.
After the pigeons chased the seagull away, each pigeon ate 3 fries, totaling 3 x 3 = 9 fries eaten by the pigeons.
So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries remaining after the pigeons.
The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 x 12 = 8 fries stolen by the raccoon.
This left 12 - 8 = 4 fries remaining before the ants carried away the last fry.
Therefore, there were initially 21 + 9 + 8 + 1 = 39 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.
False: There were 56 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

Explanation:
- Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack, leaving 42 fries.
- The seagull then ate half of 14 (7 fries), leaving 35 fries.
- The 3 pigeons each ate 3 fries, leaving 26 fries.
- The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving 8.67 fries. Since you can't have a fraction of a fry, we round down to 8 fries.
- The ants carried away the last fry, leaving 7 fries. 
- Given that there were 5 fries left after all the animal activity, we need to add 2 fries back, bringing the total to 56 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.
45.0 - 2: Let's break down the problem step by step:  1. Dave originally had 45 fries. 2. After he ate 14 fries, there were 45 - 14 = 31 fries left. 3. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries that Dave had eaten, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. 4. After the seagull ate the fries, there were 31 - 7 = 24 fries left. 5. 'X' pigeons chased the seagull away, and each pigeon ate 'X' fries. So, 'X' pigeons ate 'X' * 'X' = X^2 fries in total. 6. After the pigeons, there were 24 - X^2 fries left. 7. The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (24 - X^2) = 16 - (2/3)X^2 fries. 8. Finally, ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries remaining, meaning 16 - (2/3)X^2 - 1 = 5. 9. Solving the equation, we get: 16 - (2/3)X^2 - 1 = 5 15 - (2/3)X^2 = 5 (2/3)X^2 = 10 X^2 = 15 X = √15  Therefore, the answer for 'X' is the square root of 15.
39.0 - 1: Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Dave initially had 39 fries in the pack. 2. He ate 14 fries, so he had 39 - 14 = 25 fries left. 3. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave had eaten, so it ate 14/2 = 7 fries. After that, Dave had 25 - 7 = 18 fries left. 4. 'X' pigeons chased the seagull away. Each pigeon ate 'X' fries, so the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is 'X' * 'X', which is X^2. After the pigeons ate, Dave had 18 - X^2 fries left. 5. The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (18 - X^2) = 2/3 * (18 - X^2) fries. After this, Dave had 18 - X^2 - 2/3 * (18 - X^2) = 5 fries left. Now we can solve for 'X': 18 - X^2 - 2/3 * (18 - X^2) = 5 18 - X^2 - 2/3 * 18 + 2/3 * X^2 = 5 18 - X^2 - 12 + 2/3 * X^2 = 5 6 - X^2 + 2/3 * X^2 = 5 - X^2/3 = -1 X^2 = 3 X = √3 or approximately 1.73 So the answer of 'X' is approximately 1.73.
56.0 - 0: Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Dave bought a pack of fries with 56 fries. 2. After Dave ate 14 fries, there were 56 - 14 = 42 fries left. 3. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave had eaten, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So now there are 42 - 7 = 35 fries left. 4. 'X' pigeons chased away the seagull and each pigeon ate 'X' fries, so they ate a total of 'X' * 'X' = X^2 fries. After the pigeons ate, there were 35 - X^2 fries left. 5. The raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the fries, which is (1/3) * 35 = 35 / 3 = 11.66 fries (we can't have 0.66 of a fry, so let's assume the raccoon ate the remaining piece). 6. Finally, the ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries.  So, we have the equation 35/3 = 5, which doesn't make sense. It seems there may be a mistake in the given problem. The answer for 'X' cannot be determined with the information provided.

True: In the first week, Lloyd earned 10 x 5 = 50 dollars.
In the second week, he earned 10 x 8 = 80 dollars.
Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of 50 + 80 = 130 dollars in the first two weeks.
True: In the first week, Lloyd earned 10 dollars per hour * 5 hours = 50 dollars.
In the second week, Lloyd earned 10 dollars per hour * 8 hours = 80 dollars.

Q: There are 4 roses in a vase. The number of dahlias in the vase is 7 more than the number of roses. How many flowers are there in the vase in total?
GT : 15
True: There are 4 roses, so the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.
Therefore, there are a total of 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase.
True: There are 4 roses and 4+7=11 dahlias in the vase.
Therefore, there are a total of 4+11= 15 flowers in the vase.
False: There are 11 flowers in total in the vase. (4 roses + 4 roses + 7 dahlias = 11 flowers)
15.0 - 5: Let the number of dahlias be X + 4 (since it is 'X' more than the roses).  The total number of flowers is 15, so: 4 roses + X + 4 dahlias = 15 X + 8 = 15 X = 15 - 8 X = 7  The answer is 7.
11.0 - 0: Let the number of dahlias be represented by Y. Since there are 4 roses in the vase, the number of dahlias is X more than the number of roses. Therefore, we have: <code> Y = 4 + X </code> There are a total of 11 flowers in the vase, so: <code> 4 + Y = 11 4 + 4 + X = 11 8 + X = 11 X = 3 </code> Therefore, the answer is 3.

Q: Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs daily. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?
GT : 4
False: Let R be the number of red chickens and W be the number of white chickens.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1) R + W = total number of chickens
2) 3R + 5W = 42
3) W = R + 2

Substitute equation 3 into equation 1:
R + (R + 2) = total number of chickens
2R + 2 = total number of chickens
R = (total number of chickens - 2)/2

Substitute R back into equation 2:
3((total number of chickens - 2)/2) + 5(R + 2) = 42
Simplify and solve for the total number of chickens:
3(total number of chickens - 2) + 5(total number of chickens + 2) = 42
3total number of chickens - 6 + 5total number of chickens + 10 = 42
8total number of chickens + 4 = 42
8total number of chickens = 38
total number of chickens = 38/8
total number of chickens = 4.75

Since the total number of chickens must be a whole number, there is an error in the problem as it doesn't have a whole solution.
False: Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.
From the given information, we can create two equations:

1. R + W = total number of chickens
2. 3R + 5W = 42

Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can rewrite equation 1 as:
R + (R + 2) = total number of chickens
2R + 2 = total number of chickens
2R = total number of chickens - 2

Now we can substitute this into equation 2:
3(2R - 2) + 5W = 42
6R - 6 + 5W = 42
6R + 5W = 48

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:
6R + 5W = 48
- (3R + 5W = 42)
3R = 6
R = 2

Therefore, Jerry has 2 red chickens.
True: Let the number of red chickens be R and the number of white chickens be W. 

From the given information, we have:
R + W = total number of chickens
R eggs/day + W eggs/day = 42 eggs/day

We are also told that W = R + 2, because there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

Plugging in the values, we get:
R + (R + 2) = total number of chickens
3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equations:
2R + 2 = total number of chickens
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R + 10 = 42
8R = 32
R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.
4.75 - 1: Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2 and that R = 4.75.   Since each red chicken lays 3 eggs a day and each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day, Jerry collects X eggs daily. Therefore, we have the equation:  X = 3R + 5W  Substitute the values of R and W into the equation:  X = 3(4.75) + 5(4.75 + 2) X = 14.25 + 33.75 X = 48  Therefore, Jerry collects 48 eggs daily.
2.0 - 0: Let's say the number of red chickens is R and the number of white chickens is W. Given that Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, we can write:  W = R + 2  Given that he has 2.0 red chickens, we can write:  2.0 = R  Now, we know that the red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. So the total number of eggs collected daily is:  X = 3R + 5W  Substitute R = 2.0 and W = 2.0 + 2 into the equation:  X = 3(2.0) + 5(2.0 + 2) X = 6 + 5(4) X = 6 + 20 X = 26  Therefore, the answer is X = 26.
4.0 - 9: Jerry has 4 red chickens and 6 white chickens (2 more white chickens than red chickens). Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs Jerry collects daily can be calculated as: <code> 4(3) + 6(5) = X  12 + 30 = X  X = 42 </code> The answer is 42.

GT : 5,600
False: On Monday, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.
In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
Therefore, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.
Her sister consumed a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
Therefore, her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.
Therefore, Sue consumed 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.
False: Step 1: Calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday 
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 5 * 4 = 20 cookies on Monday
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies that Sue ate 
- The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the total calories intake by Sue 
- Since one cookie contains 200 calories, the total calories intake by Sue is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

Step 4: Calculate the total calories intake by her sister 
- The total calories intake by her sister is 5 * 200 + 13 * 200 = 3600 calories

Step 5: Calculate the difference in calories intake between Sue and her sister 
- Sue intake 9200 calories - her sister intake 3600 calories = 5600 calories

Therefore, Sue intake 5600 more calories than her sister.
False: On Monday, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.
The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
Sue intake 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.
Her sister intake 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
Her sister intake 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.
Therefore, Sue intake 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

Q: A hospital sees 500 patients daily. Each patient's consultation lasts an average of 24 minutes. The hospital charges doctors $150 per hour and charges patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these consultations?
GT : 10000
True: First, we need to calculate how many hours each patient spends in consultation:

24 minutes = 24/60 = 0.4 hours

Each patient spends 0.4 hours in consultation.

The hospital sees 500 patients daily, so the total time spent in consultations daily is:

500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

The hospital charges doctors $150 per hour, so the cost to the hospital for these consultations is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so the revenue from these consultations is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Therefore, the profit the hospital makes from these consultations is:

$40,000 (revenue) - $30,000 (cost) = $10,000 profit per day
False: First, we need to calculate how many hours of consultations are being conducted daily. 

500 patients x 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes of consultations
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours of consultations

Next, we calculate the revenue generated from the consultations:
Doctors pay: 200 hours x $150 per hour = $30,000
Patients pay: 200 hours x $200 per hour = $40,000

Total revenue = $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000

Finally, we calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - (Cost of doctors' fees)
Profit = $70,000 - $30,000 = $40,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $40,000 from these consultations daily.
True: First, we need to calculate the total consultation time for the 500 patients. 

Total consultation time = 500 patients * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes

Next, we convert the total consultation time to hours:

Total consultation time in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes = 200 hours

The hospital charges doctors $150 per hour, so the cost to the doctors for these consultations would be:

Cost to doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so the revenue from these consultations would be:

Revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Therefore, the profit the hospital makes from these consultations would be:

Profit = Revenue from patients - Cost to doctors
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these consultations.
10000.0 - 2: First, we need to calculate the total consultation time per day for all patients: 500 patients x 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes  To convert the total consultation time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes = 200 hours  The hospital charges doctors 'X' per hour and patients $200 per hour. The profit from these consultations is $10,000. Therefore, the total revenue from consultations is: 200 hours x ('X' + $200) = $10,000  Solving for 'X', we get: 200X + 40,000 = 10,000 200X = 40,000 - 10,000 200X = 30,000 X = 30,000 / 200 X = $150  Therefore, the answer is that the hospital charges doctors $150 per hour for consultations.
40000.0 - 2: First, we need to calculate how many hours of consultations are happening daily by converting the total minutes to hours.  500 patients * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes 12000 minutes / 60 minutes = 200 hours  Now, let's calculate the revenue generated from patients: 200 hours * $200 per hour = $40000  Next, let's calculate the total cost of doctors' fees: 200 hours * $X per hour = 200X  Since the hospital makes a profit of $40000 from these consultations, we can write the following equation: 40000 = 200X  Solving for X: 200X = 40000 X = 40000 / 200 X = 200  Therefore, the answer is $200 per hour.

False: Let x be the number of times the first friend rang the doorbell.
The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend rang the doorbell x + x/4 = 5x/4 times.
The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, so x = 60.
Therefore, the second friend rang the doorbell 5(60)/4 = 75 times.
The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend rang the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
The total number of times the doorbell was rung is x + 5x/4 + 60 + 70 = 60 + 75 + 60 + 70 = 265 times.
True: Let's break it down step by step:

- The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
- The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.
- The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend rang it (20 + 20/4) = 25 times.
- Finally, the first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.

Adding them all up, the doorbell was rung 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175 times. 

So, the doorbell was rung a total of 175 times.
True: The second friend rang the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 25 times.
The third friend rang the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
Therefore, the doorbell was rung a total of 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175 times.
265.0 - 0: Let's break it down step by step:  1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. 2. The second friend rang it X/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend rang the doorbell 20 + X/4 times. 3. The third friend rang the doorbell X0 times more than the fourth friend (meaning X times more), so the third friend rang the doorbell 60 + X0 times. 4. In total, the doorbell was rung 265 times: 20 + (20 + X/4) + 60 + X0 = 265 225 + X/4 + X0 = 265 225 + X + 40X = 1060 41X = 835 X = 835 / 41 X ≈ 20.37  Therefore, the answer to 'X' is approximately 20.37.
175.0 - 3: First, let's determine the total number of times the doorbell was rung: - The first friend rang it 20 times. - The second friend rang it X/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend rang it 20 + X/4 times. - The third friend rang it X0 times more than the fourth friend (which means X times more, as X0 = X), so the third friend rang it 60 + X0 times.  Therefore, the total number of times the doorbell was rung is: 20 + 20 + X/4 + 60 + X = 175 100 + X + 4X + 240 = 175 5X + 340 = 175 5X = -165 X = -33  Therefore, the value of X is -33.

He eats a cheese and egg roll for breakfast on 3 days of the week, each egg roll using 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich. He made a large portion of mac and cheese, which he ate for several dinners this week, and he put 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?
GT : 31
True: Throughout the week, Carl used 14 slices of cheese for the sandwiches (2 slices x 7 days = 14 slices).
For the breakfast egg rolls, he used 3 slices of cheese per day (2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices). So, for 3 days, he used 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.
For the mac and cheese, he used 8 slices of cheese.
Adding all the slices of cheese together, Carl used 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices of cheese in total.
True: For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich with 2 slices of cheese every day for 7 days, totaling 2 slices * 7 days = 14 slices of cheese.
For breakfast, Carl ate a cheese and egg roll with 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich for 3 days, totaling 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per roll.
So for breakfast, Carl used a total of 3 slices * 3 days = 9 slices of cheese.
For dinner, Carl made mac and cheese with 8 slices of cheese.
In total, Carl used 14 slices for lunch + 9 slices for breakfast + 8 slices for dinner = 31 slices of cheese in total.
True: For lunch, he ate a sandwich with 2 slices of cheese per day for 7 days, so 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.
For breakfast, he ate a cheese and egg roll with (2 slices + 1 slice) = 3 slices of cheese per day for 3 days, so 3 slices/day * 3 days = 9 slices.
For dinner, he made mac and cheese with 8 slices of cheese.
In total, he used 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices of cheese.

Q: In a school auditorium with 1,000 students, there are 3 entrances A, B, and C, which also serve as exits. If after a meeting, 30% of the students exited through entrance A, and the remaining 3/5 exited through entrance B, the rest exited through entrance C. Calculate the number of students who exited through entrance C.
GT : 280
True: First, we need to calculate the number of students who exited through entrances A and B.

Students exiting through entrance A: 30% of 1,000 = 0.30 * 1,000 = 300

Students exiting through entrance B: (1 - 0.30) * 1,000 * 3/5 = 0.70 * 1,000 * 3/5 = 420

Total number of students exiting through entrances A and B = 300 + 420 = 720

Therefore, the number of students who exited through entrance C = Total number of students - Number of students exiting through entrances A and B
= 1,000 - 720
= 280

Therefore, 280 students exited through entrance C.
True: Let x be the number of students who exited through entrance C.

The total number of students who exited through entrance A is 30% of 1,000, which is 0.3(1,000) = 300.

The total number of students who exited through entrance B is 3/5 of the remaining students, which is 3/5(1,000 - 300) = 420.

The total number of students who exited through entrance C is the remaining students, which is 1,000 - 300 - 420 = 280.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through entrance C is 280.
True: Let x be the number of students who exited through entrance C.

30% of the 1,000 students exited through entrance A, which is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.
The remaining students who exited through entrance B is 3/5 * (1000 - 300) = 3/5 * 700 = 420 students.
Therefore, the total number of students who exited through entrances A and B is 300 + 420 = 720 students.

The number of students who exited through entrance C is the total number of students (1000) minus the number of students who exited through entrances A and B, so x = 1000 - 720 = 280 students.

Therefore, there were 280 students who exited through entrance C.

True: On Tuesday, the water in the tank is 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep.
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet deep.
True: On Tuesday, the water in the tank deepens by 7 feet, so the depth becomes 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of Tuesday's depth, so it is 2/3 * 24 feet = 16 feet.

Q: Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as last year. After baking, he realizes he actually made 15 cookies more than he intended. While cooling the cookies, he dropped 5 cookies, and now he has 110 cookies in total. How many cookies did Henry make last year?
GT : 50
True: Let X be the number of cookies Henry intended to make this year. 

He wanted to make twice as many as last year, so last year he made X/2 cookies. 

After baking, he actually made X + 15 cookies. 

He dropped 5 cookies, so he had X + 15 - 5 = X + 10 cookies left.

Since he has 110 cookies in total, we can write the equation:

X + 10 = 110

Solving for X, we get:

X = 110 - 10
X = 100

Therefore, Henry intended to make 100 cookies this year, and last year he made 100/2 = 50 cookies.
False: Let's break down the information we have:

- Henry intended to make x number of cookies last year.
- He ended up making 15 more cookies than intended, so the total number of cookies he made this year is x + 15.
- He wanted to make twice as many as last year, so 2x is the number of cookies he intended to make this year.
- After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies in total.

Putting this all together:
2x - 5 = 110
2x = 115
x = 57.5

Since you can't have half a cookie, we can conclude that Henry intended to make 57 cookies last year.
True: Let x be the number of cookies Henry intended to make.

Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so this year he intended to make 2x cookies.
However, he actually made 15 more cookies than he intended, so the actual number of cookies he made is 2x + 15.
After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies in total, so we can create the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110
2x + 10 = 110
2x = 100
x = 50

Therefore, Henry intended to make 50 cookies last year.
50.0 - 6: Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he intended to make 50 * 2 = 100 cookies. However, he ended up making 15 cookies more than he intended, so he actually made 100 + 15 = 115 cookies. He accidentally dropped 5 cookies while cooling them, so in total he has X = 115 - 5 = 110 cookies.  Therefore, the answer is X = 110.
57.0 - 2: Henry made 57 cookies last year and wanted to make twice as many this year, so he intended to make 57 * 2 = 114 cookies. But he actually made 15 more, so he made 114 + 15 = 129 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has X cookies in total. Therefore, X = 129 - 5 = 124. The answer is 124.

Q: Josie grows grapes on her 10-acre farm. Each acre yields 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. How many barrels of wine does her farm produce per year?
GT : 100
True: Josie's farm produces a total of 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes per year.
This amount of grapes produces 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year. 
Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.
False: Josie's 10-acre farm would yield a total of 50 tons of grapes per year (10 acres x 5 tons per acre). Each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, so the farm would produce 100 barrels of wine per year (50 tons x 2 barrels per ton).
False: Josie's 10-acre farm yields a total of 50 tons of grapes per year (10 acres x 5 tons per acre). Each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, so her farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year (50 tons x 2 barrels per ton).
100.0 - 9: Each acre yields 5 tons of grapes, so 10 acres would yield 10 * 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year. If each ton of grapes produces 'X' barrels of wine, then the total number of barrels produced would be: <code> 50 * X = 100  X = 100 / 50  X = 2 </code> Therefore, each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine.
2.0 - 0: Each acre yields 5 tons of grapes, so 10 acres would yield 10 * 5 = 50 tons of grapes. If 50 tons of grapes produce 2 barrels of wine, then each ton produces 2/50 = 0.04 barrels of wine. Therefore, X = 0.04 barrels of wine per ton of grapes.

Q: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is he to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers (expressed as a percentage)?
GT : 25
False: To find out how much more likely Jerry is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers, we first need to calculate the probabilities of each event.

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, 6). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

2. Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers:
The consecutive even numbers on a six-sided die are (2, 4) and (4, 6). So the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 2/6 * 1/5 = 1/15.

Now, to find out how much more likely Jerry is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers, we can compare their probabilities:

1/2 - 1/15 = 7/30

Convert this to a percentage:
(7/30) * 100% = 23.33%

Therefore, Jerry is 23.33% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers.
False: To find the likelihood of rolling a number greater than 3, we look at the numbers 4, 5, and 6 on the die. There are 3 out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 or 50%.

To find the likelihood of rolling two consecutive even numbers, we look at the numbers 2 and 4 or 4 and 6. There are 2 out of 6 possible outcomes for each pair, so the combined probability is 2/6 * 2/6 = 4/36 or approximately 11.11%.

Therefore, Jerry is 50% - 11.11% = 38.89% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers.
False: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we have 3 out of 6 possible outcomes (4, 5, 6) which is a probability of 3/6 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers, we have 1 out of 6 possible outcomes (2, 4) followed by another 1 out of 6 possible outcomes (4, 6) which is a probability of (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/36.

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5 and the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 1/36. 

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers, we can calculate the difference in probabilities: 0.5 - 1/36 = 17/36.

Expressed as a percentage, 17/36 is approximately 47.2%. So, Jerry is approximately 47.2% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers.

Q: Janice borrowed $2,000 and promised to return an additional 10% of that amount. If she plans to pay $165 per month for 12 months, what is the remaining debt for Janice at that time?
GT : 220
True: First, let's calculate the total amount Janice needs to pay back after adding 10% to the borrowed amount:

$2,000 + ($2,000 * 0.10) = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janice will pay over the 12 months:

$165 * 12 = $1,980

Finally, let's calculate the remaining debt for Janice after 12 months:

$2,200 - $1,980 = $220

So, the remaining debt for Janice after 12 months will be $220.
True: The total amount Janice needs to repay, including the 10% additional amount, is $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

Over 12 months, Janice will pay a total of $165 x 12 = $1,980.

Therefore, the remaining debt for Janice after 12 months will be $2,200 - $1,980 = $220.
True: First, calculate the total amount Janice needs to pay back:
Original loan amount = $2,000
Additional 10% = 0.10 * $2,000 = $200
Total amount to pay back = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200

Next, calculate the total amount Janice will pay over 12 months:
Monthly payment = $165
Total payments over 12 months = $165 * 12 = $1,980

Subtract the total payments made from the total amount to pay back:
Remaining debt = $2,200 - $1,980 = $220

Therefore, after 12 months, Janice will still owe $220.

GT : 140
True: It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, so 10/3 = 3.33 minutes to cover 1 mile.
Therefore, it would take 3.33 minutes x 42 miles = 139.86 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city. 
Therefore, it would take approximately 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
True: It will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city. 

To calculate this, we divide the total distance of the city (42 miles) by the distance covered in 10 minutes (3 miles). 
42 miles / 3 miles = 14 intervals of 10 minutes. 
14 intervals * 10 minutes = 140 minutes. 

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
True: It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, so for 42 miles it would take:

42 miles / 3 miles = 14 intervals of 10 minutes

So, it would take 14 intervals of 10 minutes, which is 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Q: On Monday, Walter walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, his walking distance was six times his Monday distance. From Monday to Wednesday, his total mileage was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk in total on Wednesday?
GT : 13
True:  Let's first find out how many miles Walter walked on Tuesday:
Tuesday's distance = 6 * Monday's distance
Tuesday's distance = 6 * 4 = 24 miles

Now, let's find out how many miles Walter walked on Wednesday:
Total mileage on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday = 4 + 24 + Wednesday's distance
41 = 4 + 24 + Wednesday's distance
41 = 28 + Wednesday's distance
Wednesday's distance = 41 - 28
Wednesday's distance = 13 miles

Therefore, Walter walked a total of 13 miles on Wednesday.
False: Let's denote the distance Walter walked on Monday as x miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6x miles.

From Monday to Wednesday, his total mileage was 41 miles, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6x + (6x + 4) = 41
13x + 4 = 41
13x = 37
x = 37/13
x = 2.846 miles

So, on Wednesday, Walter walked:
6x + 4 = 6(2.846) + 4 ≈ 17.076 miles

Therefore, Walter walked a total of approximately 17.076 miles on Wednesday.
True: First, we know that Walter walked 4 miles on Monday. 
On Tuesday, his walking distance was 6 times his Monday distance, which means he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.
Therefore, from Monday to Tuesday, Walter walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
Since his total mileage from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles, this means he walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday. 
Therefore, Walter walked a total of 13 miles on Wednesday.
13.0 - 1: Walter walked 4 miles on Monday, so on Tuesday he walked 6 times that distance, which is 4 x 6 = 24 miles. The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is X miles. Given that he walked 13 miles on Wednesday, we can write the following equation: \[4 + 24 + X = 13\] \[28 + X = 13\] \[X = 13 - 28\] \[X = -15\] The answer is -15.
17.076 - 0: On Tuesday, Walter walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles. From Monday to Wednesday, his total mileage was X miles. <code> X = 4 (Monday) + 24 (Tuesday) + 17.076 (Wednesday)  X = 45.076 </code> The answer is 45.076 miles.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so they will need 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle.
True: Kalinda can assemble 4 pieces per minute, while her mom can assemble 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can assemble 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Q: Soro must finish reading 4 pages of a science textbook, 20 pages of a social studies textbook, 7 pages of a history textbook, and 8 pages of a geography textbook. Soro read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to complete all his reading assignments, how many pages does he need to read on average each day?
GT : 6
True: First, calculate how many pages Soro needs to read in total:

4 pages + 20 pages + 7 pages + 8 pages = 39 pages

Then, subtract the pages he read on Monday:

39 total pages - 15 pages read = 24 pages left to read

Since Soro has 4 more days to complete his reading assignments, divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Soro needs to read an average of 6 pages each day to finish all his reading assignments on time.
True: Soro needs to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.
He already read 15 pages, so he still needs to read 39 - 15 = 24 pages.
He has 4 more days to complete his reading assignments, so he needs to read an average of 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day. 
Therefore, Soro needs to read an average of 6 pages per day.
True: To find the average number of pages Soro needs to read each day, we first need to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Total pages he needs to read = 4 (science) + 20 (social studies) + 7 (history) + 8 (geography) = 39 pages

Pages read on Monday = 15 pages

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Days left to complete reading = 4 days

Average number of pages to read each day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages

Therefore, Soro needs to read an average of 6 pages per day to complete all his reading assignments on time.

Q: Jessica is trying to figure out how much she needs to pay monthly for all her debts. Her student loan's minimum monthly payment is 300 dollars, her credit card's minimum monthly payment is 200 dollars, and her mortgage's minimum monthly payment is 500 dollars. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, how much does she pay in a year?
GT : 18000
True: First, we need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all of Jessica's debts:

300 (student loan) + 200 (credit card) + 500 (mortgage) = 1000 dollars

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will pay an additional 500 dollars each month (1000 * 0.5 = 500). 

Therefore, Jessica will pay a total of 1500 dollars each month for all her debts.

To calculate how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

1500 * 12 = 18000 dollars

So, Jessica will pay a total of 18,000 dollars in a year for all her debts.
False: First, let's calculate how much Jessica needs to pay monthly for each of her debts if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment:

- Student loan: 300 dollars * 1.5 = 450 dollars
- Credit card: 200 dollars * 1.5 = 300 dollars
- Mortgage: 500 dollars * 1.5 = 750 dollars

Now, let's add up these amounts to find out how much Jessica needs to pay monthly for all her debts:

450 dollars + 300 dollars + 750 dollars = 1500 dollars

Since Jessica pays this amount monthly, we can calculate how much she pays in a year:

1500 dollars * 12 months = 18,000 dollars

Therefore, Jessica pays 18,000 dollars in a year for all her debts if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment.
True: First, let's calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her debts:

Student loan: 300 * 1.5 = 450 dollars
Credit card: 200 * 1.5 = 300 dollars
Mortgage: 500 * 1.5 = 750 dollars

Total monthly payment = 450 + 300 + 750 = 1500 dollars

To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

1500 * 12 = 18000 dollars

Therefore, Jessica pays 18,000 dollars in a year for all her debts.
18000.0 - 3: Jessica's total monthly payments are the sum of her student loan, credit card, and mortgage payments. She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, so the total monthly payment is 1.5 times the sum of the minimum payments.   Given: Student loan payment = $300 Credit card payment = $200 Total annual payment = $18,000  Let's find the total monthly payment first: Total annual payment = Total monthly payment * 12 $18,000 = Total monthly payment * 12 Total monthly payment = $18,000 / 12 Total monthly payment = $1500  Now, we can write the equation to find the mortgage payment: Total monthly payment = Student loan payment + Credit card payment + Mortgage payment $1500 = $300 + $200 + X $1500 = $500 + X X = $1500 - $500 X = $1000  Therefore, the answer is that the mortgage's minimum monthly payment is $1000.
50.0 - 0: Jessica's total minimum payments are 300 + 200 + X dollars. If she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will pay 1.5 times the total minimum payments in a year, which is 50.0 dollars. So, we can write the following equation:  300 + 200 + X = 1.5 * (300 + 200 + X) 500 + X = 450 + 300 + 1.5X X = 750 - 500 X = 250  So, the answer is 250 dollars for the mortgage's minimum monthly payment.

Q: James has 6 more candies than Robert. John's candies are twice that of Robert's. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?
GT : 21
True: First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John's candies are twice that of Robert's, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find out how many Robert has.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now we know that Robert has 27 candies. 

Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can add 6 to Robert's candies.

James's candies = Robert's candies + 6
James's candies = 27 + 6
James's candies = 33

Therefore, James has 33 candies. 

Now we can find out how many more candies John has than James.

John's candies - James's candies
54 - 33
21

So, John has 21 more candies than James.
True: First, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2: 54 / 2 = 27 candies for Robert.
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.
Now we need to find out how many more candies John has than James: 54 - 33 = 21 candies. 
Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.
True: First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John's candies are twice that of Robert's, Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.
Therefore, John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

Q: Lori ordered 2 submarine sandwiches for $7.50 each, 2 bags of fries for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each for delivery. There is an additional 20% delivery charge, and she wants to tip $5.00. How much does her order cost?
GT : 29
True: First, let's calculate the cost of the sandwiches: 
2 x $7.50 = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the fries:
2 x $1.50 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the subtotal of the order:
$15.00 (sandwiches) + $3.00 (fries) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the 20% delivery charge:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the tip:
$20.00 (subtotal) + $4.00 (delivery charge) = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip:
$24.00 (total cost before tip) + $5.00 (tip) = $29.00

So, Lori's order cost $29.00.
True: The total cost of the sandwiches is $7.50 x 2 = $15.00
The total cost of the fries is $1.50 x 2 = $3.00
The total cost of the cookies is $1.00 x 2 = $2.00
The total cost of the food before delivery charge and tip is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

20% delivery charge on $20.00 is $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

The total cost of the order with delivery charge is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the total cost of Lori's order is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00. 

Therefore, Lori's order costs $29.00 in total.
True: Each submarine sandwich costs $7.50 x 2 = $15.00
Each bag of fries cost $1.50 x 2 = $3.00
Each cookie costs $1.00 x 2 = $2.00
The total cost of the items before delivery charge and tip is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
The delivery charge is 20% of $20.00 which is $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00
Adding the delivery charge, the total cost is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Adding the $5.00 tip, the final cost of the order is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00. 
Therefore, Lori's order costs $29.00 in total.

GT : 500
True: Poppy has completed 1/4 of the puzzle, which is 1000 pieces / 4 = 250 pieces.
This leaves 1000 pieces - 250 pieces = 750 pieces remaining.
After her mom completed 1/3 of the remaining pieces, there are 750 pieces * (2/3) = 500 pieces left to assemble.
True: Poppy has completed 250 pieces (1/4 of 1,000 pieces) on the board. This means there are 750 pieces left to assemble. 

After Poppy's mom completes a third of the remaining pieces, she completes 250 pieces (1/3 of 750 pieces). 

So, there are 500 pieces left to assemble after Poppy and her mom have completed their portions.
True: Poppy has completed 1/4 of the puzzle, which is 1000 x 1/4 = 250 pieces.
There are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left to assemble.
Her mom then completes 1/3 of the remaining pieces, which is 750 x 1/3 = 250 pieces.

Q: Kim founded his own housekeeping service company and is calculating how much profit he can make from his clients. He already has 3 clients but is negotiating with 5 potential clients, confident enough to include them in his calculations. Cleaning each client's house will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2, and each pack of cloths costs $5. These are his only expenses. According to calculations, his total weekly income will be $92. Considering profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much profit does Lucas make per week?
GT : 20
True: First, let's calculate the total expenses per week:
2 bottles of bleach per client x $2 per bottle x 8 total clients = $32
1 pack of cloths per client x $5 per pack x 8 total clients = $40
Total expenses per week = $32 + $40 = $72

Now, let's calculate the profit per week:
Total income per week = $92
Total expenses per week = $72
Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim makes a profit of $20 per week.
False: First, we need to calculate the total expenses for cleaning each client's house:

2 bottles of bleach x $2/bottle = $4
1 pack of cloths x $5/pack = $5
Total expenses per client = $4 + $5 = $9

Now, we can calculate the total expenses for all 3 current clients:

3 clients x $9/client = $27

Next, we calculate the total expenses for all 8 potential clients:

8 clients x $9/client = $72

Now, let's calculate the total income from all 11 clients:

Total income = $92

Now, we can calculate Kim's total profit per week:

Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $27 - $72 = $-7

Therefore, Kim actually loses $7 per week with his current expenses and income.
True: First, let's calculate the total expenses for cleaning all clients' houses.
Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach, which cost $2 each, so 2 * $2 = $4 per client for bleach.
Each client also requires a pack of cloths, which costs $5 each.
So, the total cost per client for cleaning supplies is $4 + $5 = $9 per client.

Kim has 3 current clients, so the total cost for cleaning supplies for them is 3 * $9 = $27.

He is negotiating with 5 potential clients, so the total cost for cleaning supplies for them would be 5 * $9 = $45.

Therefore, the total weekly expenses for cleaning supplies would be $27 + $45 = $72.

Now, let's calculate the profit Kim makes per week.
His total weekly income is $92 and his total weekly expenses for cleaning supplies are $72.
So, his weekly profit would be $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, Lucas makes a profit of $20 per week.
20.0 - 1: Let's break down the problem:  - Each client requires 'X' bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. - Each bottle of bleach costs $'X' and each pack of cloths costs $5. - Total weekly income = $9X  - Profit per week = $20  Profit is calculated as follows: Total Income - Total Expenses  Total Income = $9X (from cleaning) Total Expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths  Cost of bleach = X * X (as each bottle costs $X) Cost of cloths = 5 (as each pack costs $5)  Total Expenses = X * X + 5  Profit = $9X - (X * X + 5)  Given that the profit is $20, we can write the equation:  $9X - (X * X + 5) = $20  Simplify the equation:  9X - X^2 - 5 = 20  Rearrange the equation:  X^2 - 9X + 25 = 0  Now, we can solve for X using the quadratic formula:  X = (9 ± sqrt(9^2 - 4*1*25)) / 2*1 X = (9 ± sqrt(81 - 100)) / 2 X = (9 ± sqrt(-19)) / 2  Since the square root of a negative number results in an imaginary number, the value of X will not be a real number. Therefore, the solution may not be possible with the given information.
7.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given: - Kim has 3 current clients and negotiating with 5 potential clients, so he will have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients. - Each client's house cleaning requires 'X' bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. - The cost of each bottle of bleach is $'X' and the cost of each pack of cloths is $5. - Total weekly income is $9'X'. - Total weekly expenses will be the cost of bleach and cloths for each client, so it will be 8 clients * ('X' + $5) = 8X + 40. - Kim's profit is the different between total income and total expenses, which is $9'X - (8'X + 40) = $7.0.  We can now set up the equation for X: 9X - (8X + 40) = 7 9X - 8X - 40 = 7 X - 40 = 7 X = 47  Therefore, the answer is X = 47.

GT : 250
True: Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, so in total, he talks to his boss for 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.
Adding this with the additional 300 minutes with others, Jason has used 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes this month.
Therefore, Jason has 1,000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes left in his phone plan for this month.
True: Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, so in a 30-day month, he talks to his boss for 15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes with his boss.
In total, Jason has talked for 450 minutes with his boss + 300 minutes with others = 750 minutes this month.
Jason has 1,000 minutes in his plan, so he has 1,000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes left for the month.

Q: Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Layla's. Four years later, his salary has increased, and his income is 40% higher than it was four years ago. If Adrian's salary and Layla's salary rise simultaneously, and Adrian's income was $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary of both people four years later.
GT : 95200
False: First, let's find Adrian's current salary:
Adrian's income four years ago = $40,000
His income is now 40% higher than it was four years ago, so his current income = $40,000 + 40% * $40,000 = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

Now, let's find Layla's current salary:
Adrian's current salary is 30% higher than Layla's current salary, so Layla's current salary = $56,000 / 1.30 = $43,076.92

Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later is:
$56,000 (Adrian's salary) + $43,076.92 (Layla's salary) = $99,076.92.
False: Let's start by finding Adrian's salary four years ago, which is $40,000.

If Adrian's current salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago, then his current salary is:
$40,000 + 40/100 * $40,000 = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

If Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Layla's salary, then Layla's salary is:
$40,000 / (1 + 30/100) = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approx.)

Now, if both salaries rise for years, Adrian's salary four years later will be:
$56,000 + 40/100 * $56,000 = $56,000 + $22,400 = $78,400

Layla's salary four years later will be:
$30,769.23 + 40/100 * $30,769.23 = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92

Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later will be:
$78,400 + $43,076.92 = $121,476.92
False: If Adrian's income was $40,000 four years ago, his total salary four years later would be:

$40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

Since Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Layla's, Layla's total salary four years later would be:

$56,000 / 1.30 = $43,076.92

Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later would be:

$56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.
99076.92 - 0: Let's break this problem down step by step.  1. Adrian's income was $40,000 four years ago. 2. Adrian's salary has increased by 40%, so his current salary is:    $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000 3. Layla's salary is 30% lower than Adrian's, so Layla's current salary is:    $56,000 - ($56,000 * 0.30) = $56,000 - $16,800 = $39,200  Therefore, the total salary of both people four years later is: $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200  It seems that the provided answer of 99076.92 may not be accurate based on the calculation.
121476.92 - 0: Let's denote Layla's salary as X. Adrian's salary is 30% higher than Layla's, so his salary is 1.3X. Adrian's income four years ago was $40,000, so his current salary is 40% higher, which means it is 1.4 times his previous salary.  Therefore, Adrian's current salary is 1.4 * 40,000 = $56,000. Since Layla and Adrian's salaries rise simultaneously, we can calculate Layla's current salary as 1.4X.  The total salary of both people four years later is Layla's current salary + Adrian's current salary = 1.4X + $56,000.  We are given that the total salary four years later is $121,476.92. So we can write: 1.4X + 56,000 = 121,476.92 1.4X = 65,476.92 X = 65,476.92 / 1.4 X = 46,768.51  Therefore, Layla's current salary (X) is $46,768.51 and Adrian's current salary is 1.4 times that amount, which is $65,476.92.  The total salary of both people four years later is Layla's current salary + Adrian's current salary = $46,768.51 + $65,476.92 = $112,245.43.  The provided answer of $121,476.92 may have been calculated with slightly different values or rounding.

False:  Andrew will spend a total of 9 days traveling. (6 days for the bus trip to Rochester + 3 days for the drive back)
9.0 - 3: Let's denote the time it takes to take a bus from New Jersey to Rochester as X days. Since driving back takes half that time, driving back would take X/2 days.  Therefore, the total time Andrew would spend traveling would be X days for the bus trip and X/2 days for the drive back, resulting in X + X/2 = 9 days. Solving for X: X + X/2 = 9 2X + X = 18 3X = 18 X = 6  So, the answer is X = 6 days.
3.0 - 0: Let's denote the time it takes to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester as X days. Driving back will take half that time, so it will take X/2 days. Therefore, the total time for the round trip will be X + X/2 = 3 days.  Solving for X: X + X/2 = 3 2X + X = 6 3X = 6 X = 2  Therefore, it takes 2 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

Q: Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. If there is a group of 10 ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?
GT : 5
True: The group of 10 ducks would need to eat 35 pounds of insects per week (10 ducks x 3.5 pounds each). 

To find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, divide 35 pounds by 7 days in a week. 

35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds of insects per day 

Therefore, the group of 10 ducks would need to eat 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.
True: Each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for 10 ducks, the total amount needed per week would be 35 pounds (3.5 pounds x 10 ducks). 

To find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, divide the total weekly amount by 7 days:

35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds of insects per day

Therefore, the group of 10 ducks would need to eat 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.
False: Each duck needs to eat 0.35 pounds of insects per day (3.5 pounds per week / 7 days). 
Therefore, a group of 10 ducks would need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per day (0.35 pounds per duck * 10 ducks).
5.0 - 2: If the ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, that means they need 3.5/7 = 0.5 pounds per day.   If the group of ducks need 5.0 pounds of insects per day, and there are X ducks in the group, then:  0.5 X = 5   X = 5 / 0.5   X = 10   So, the answer is 10 ducks in the group.
10.0 - 0: Each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, which is equivalent to 0.5 pounds per day (since there are 7 days in a week). If there are X ducks in the group, they will need 10.0 pounds per day. So, we can write the following equation:  X * 0.5 = 10 X = 10 / 0.5 X = 20  The answer is 20 ducks.

Q: Russell works at a pet shop and is allocating straw to rodents. The mice are kept in 3 cages, each mouse getting 6 straws. The hamsters are kept individually in 10 cages, each hamster getting 5 straws. Additionally, there is a cage of rabbits that received 20 straws. No other straw is used anywhere else in the pet shop. If 160 straws were given to small rodents, how many mice are there per cage?
GT : 5
True: Let's denote the number of mice in each cage as x.

Since there are 3 cages of mice and each mouse gets 6 straws, the total number of straws allocated to mice is 3 * 6 * x = 18x.

There are also 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 straws, so the total number of straws allocated to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The cage of rabbits received 20 straws.

So the total number of straws allocated to all small rodents is 18x + 50 + 20 = 160.

Combining like terms, we get:

18x + 70 = 160

Subtracting 70 from both sides:

18x = 90

Dividing by 18:

x = 5

Therefore, each cage of mice contains 5 mice.
False: Let's first calculate the total number of straws used for the mice and hamsters:
Number of straws for mice = 3 cages * 6 straws per mouse = 18 straws
Number of straws for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 straws per hamster = 50 straws
Number of straws for rabbits = 20 straws

Total number of straws used = 18 straws + 50 straws + 20 straws = 88 straws

Since 160 straws were given to small rodents, and 88 of those were given to mice, the remaining (160 - 88) = 72 straws were given to hamsters.

Let's calculate the number of hamsters:
Number of hamsters = 72 straws / 5 straws per hamster = 14.4 hamsters

Since hamsters cannot be in fractions, we can assume there are 14 hamsters.

Now, let's calculate the number of mice:
Number of mice = (160 total straws - 50 straws for hamsters - 20 straws for rabbits) / 6 straws per mouse
Number of mice = 90 / 6 = 15 mice

Therefore, there are 15 mice per cage in the pet shop.
False: Let's first figure out how many straws were given to each type of small rodent:

- Mice: 3 cages * 6 straws per mouse = 18 straws
- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 straws per hamster = 50 straws
- Rabbits: 20 straws

Total straws used for small rodents = 18 (mice) + 50 (hamsters) = 68

Given that 160 straws were given to small rodents, subtracting the straws given to rabbits leaves us with 160 - 20 = 140 straws given to mice and hamsters.

If 68 straws were given to hamsters, then 140 - 68 = 72 straws were given to mice.

Since there are 3 cages of mice, each cage must have 72 / 3 = 24 mice.

Therefore, there are 24 mice per cage.
5.0 - 5: Let's break down the information given: - There are 3 cages of mice, with each mouse getting 6 straws. - There are X cages of hamsters, with each hamster getting 5 straws. - There is 1 cage of rabbits, which received 20 straws. - In total, 160 straws were given to small rodents. - There are 5 mice per cage.  So, the total number of straws given to mice is 3 cages * 5 mice per cage * 6 straws per mouse = 90 straws. The total number of straws given to hamsters is X cages * 5 straws per hamster. And the total number of straws given to rabbits is 20 straws.  Therefore, the total number of straws given to small rodents is 90 (mice) + X*5 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits), which equals 160.  So, the equation becomes: 90 + 5X + 20 = 160 5X + 110 = 160 5X = 50 X = 10  Therefore, the answer to X is 10.
15.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given: - There are 3 cages of mice, with each mouse getting 6 straws, so the total straws for mice = 3 cages * 15 mice/cage * 6 straws/mouse = 270 straws - There is 1 cage of rabbits with 20 straws - The total straws given to small rodents is 160 - The remaining straws are allocated to 'X' cages of hamsters, with each hamster getting 5 straws  So, we can write the equation: 270 (mice) + 20 (rabbits) + 5X (hamsters) = 160 (total straws)  Solving for X: 270 + 20 + 5X = 160 5X = 160 - 270 - 20 5X = -130 X = -130/5 X = -26  The answer is -26, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It's possible there was an error in the problem setup.
24.0 - 1: Let's break this down:  1. There are 3 cages of mice, each getting 6 straws, so the mice received 3 * 6 = 18 straws in total. 2. There is a cage of rabbits that received 20 straws. 3. The total straws given to small rodents is 160, which means the mice and rabbits received a total of 18 + 20 = 38 straws. 4. This leaves 160 - 38 = 122 straws for the hamsters. 5. Each hamster gets 5 straws, so the number of cages needed for the hamsters can be calculated as X = 122 / 5 = 24.4.  Since you can't have a fraction of a cage, the answer for X would be 24 cages for the hamsters.

Q: Two athletics teams compete in a 4x400 meter relay race. In this race, each team has 4 members, each running 400 meters or one lap around a standard track. In these two teams, one team is very uniform, with each member finishing the 400-meter segment exactly in 55 seconds. The other team is less uniform, with the first player finishing the 400-meter segment in 60 seconds, then each subsequent player running 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, by how many seconds did the faster team win?
GT : 2
True: To find out by how many seconds the faster team won, we need to calculate the total time it took for each team to complete the race.

For the uniform team:
Each member finishes in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the faster team:
The first member finishes in 60 seconds, the second member finishes in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third member finishes in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth member finishes in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
So the total time for the faster team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team won by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.
True: To find out how many seconds the faster team won by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

For the uniform team:
Each member finishes in 55 seconds, so the total time taken by the team would be 4 members x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

For the less uniform team:
1st member finishes in 60 seconds
2nd member finishes in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
3rd member finishes in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
4th member finishes in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time taken by the team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Therefore, the faster team won by 220 - 222 = 2 seconds.
True: Let's calculate the total time it took for each team to finish the race.

For the uniform team:
Each member finished the 400-meter segment in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the non-uniform team:
The first player finished in 60 seconds.
The second player finished in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third player finished in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth player finished in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
So the total time for the team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team won by 220 - 222 = 2 seconds.

GT : 240
True: Miguel uses 2 reams of paper per week, which is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets per week.
In a month with 4 weeks, he will use 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks = 240 sheets in a month.
True: Miguel uses 2 reams of paper per week, so in a month (4 weeks), he would use:
2 reams/week * 4 weeks = 8 reams

Since one ream has 30 sheets, Miguel would use:
8 reams * 30 sheets = 240 sheets

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper in a month.
True: Miguel uses 2 reams of paper per week, so he uses 2*30 = 60 sheets per week.
In a month, there are typically 4 weeks, so in a month, he uses 60*4 = 240 sheets of paper.

Q: Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. They spend 3 dollars on lemons and 2 dollars on sugar for every gallon of lemonade they make. They can make 20 cups per gallon, selling each cup for 0.50 dollars. If their profit is 25 dollars, how much did they spend on lemons?
GT : 15
True: First, calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade:
Cost of lemons = $3
Cost of sugar = $2
Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5

Next, calculate their total revenue:
Revenue per cup = $0.50
Number of cups per gallon = 20
Total revenue per gallon = $0.50 * 20 = $10

Now, calculate their total profit per gallon:
Profit per gallon = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

Given that their total profit is $25, divide this by their profit per gallon to find out how many gallons they sold:
Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

Finally, calculate how much they spent on lemons:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons for 5 gallons = $3 * 5 = $15

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons.
True: First, we need to calculate the total cost of making the lemonade. 
They spend 3 dollars on lemons and 2 dollars on sugar for every gallon of lemonade, so the total cost per gallon is 3 + 2 = 5 dollars. 
They can make 20 cups per gallon, selling each cup for 0.50 dollars, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * 0.50 = 10 dollars. 
Their profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost, so 10 - 5 = 5 dollars. 
If their profit is 25 dollars, then they must have made 25 / 5 = 5 gallons of lemonade. 
Therefore, they spent 3 dollars on lemons per gallon, so they spent 3 * 5 = 15 dollars on lemons. 
Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent 15 dollars on lemons.
True: First, let's calculate how much they make from selling one gallon of lemonade:
20 cups/gallon * $0.50/cup = $10/gallon

Next, let's calculate how much they spend on ingredients for one gallon of lemonade:
$3 for lemons + $2 for sugar = $5/gallon

Their profit from selling one gallon of lemonade is:
$10 - $5 = $5/gallon

If their profit is $25, then they must have sold:
$25 / $5/gallon = 5 gallons

Therefore, they spent:
5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 on lemons.

Q: Jerry has two pools, both with leaks, each draining at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool. Now the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool. How much water is currently in the smaller pool?
GT : 8
False: Let x be the amount of water in the smaller pool.

Since both pools are draining at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago was x + 4(4) = x + 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the larger pool 4 minutes ago was 2(x + 16) = 2x + 32 gallons.

Now, the amount of water in the smaller pool is x - 4(4) = x - 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the larger pool now is 4(x - 16) = 4x - 64 gallons.

Since the amount of water in the larger pool is now four times the amount of water in the smaller pool:
4x - 64 = 4(x - 16)
4x - 64 = 4x - 64
0 = 0

This means that the amount of water in the smaller pool is currently x - 16 gallons.

Therefore, currently, there is x - 16 gallons of water in the smaller pool.
False: Let x be the amount of water in the smaller pool.

Before the leak started, the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool, so the larger pool had 2x gallons of water.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in the smaller pool after 4 minutes is x - 4*4 = x - 16 gallons.

Similarly, the amount of water in the larger pool after 4 minutes is 2x - 4*4 = 2x - 16 gallons.

Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool, so:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
2x + 64 - 16 = 4x
48 = 2x
x = 24

Therefore, the amount of water currently in the smaller pool is 24 gallons.
False: Let x be the amount of water currently in the smaller pool.

Since both pools are draining at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago was x + 4*4 = x + 16 gallons.

At that time, the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool, so the amount of water in the larger pool 4 minutes ago was 2(x + 16) = 2x + 32 gallons.

Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool, so the amount of water in the larger pool currently is 4x.

Since both pools are still leaking at the same rate, the amount of water in the larger pool currently is 4x - 4*4 = 4x - 16 gallons.

Since this amount is also equal to the amount of water in the larger pool 4 minutes ago (2x + 32), we have:
4x - 16 = 2x + 32
2x = 48
x = 24

Therefore, there are currently 24 gallons of water in the smaller pool.
16.0 - 1: Let's denote the initial amount of water in the smaller pool as S and the initial amount of water in the larger pool as L. The rate of draining for each pool is X gallons per minute.  Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool: L - 4X = 2(S - 4X)  Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool: L = 4S  Given that there is currently 16.0 units of water in the smaller pool: S = 16  Substitute S = 16 into the equations above: L = 4(16) L = 64  Now, use L = 64 and S = 16 in the first equation to solve for X: 64 - 4X = 2(16 - 4X) 64 - 4X = 32 - 8X 4X = 32 X = 8  The answer is X = 8.
24.0 - 1: Let's denote the initial amount of water in the smaller pool as S and in the larger pool as L.   Four minutes ago: - Amount of water in the smaller pool = S - 4*X - Amount of water in the larger pool = L - 4*X Given that the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool: L - 4*X = 2*(S - 4*X)  Now: - Amount of water in the smaller pool = S - Amount of water in the larger pool = L Given that the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool: L = 4*S  Given that there is currently 24.0 units of water in the smaller pool: S = 24  Substitute S = 24 into L = 4*S: L = 4*24 L = 96  Substitute S = 24 and L = 96 into L - 4*X = 2*(S - 4*X): 96 - 4*X = 2*(24 - 4*X) 96 - 4*X = 48 - 8*X 4*X = 48 - 96 4*X = -48 X = -12  The answer is -12.

Q: Brinley is a student in Mr. Burt's math class, who holds 6 tests each semester. He allows students to drop the lowest score from their semester average. If Brinley's scores in the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, what score does he need on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93?
GT : 98
False: To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can first calculate his current average.

First, we drop his lowest score, which is 71:
(89 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 4 = 367 / 4 = 91.75

So, Brinley's current average is 91.75.

To achieve an average of 93 for all 6 tests, he needs a total of:
93 * 6 = 558

Brinley's current total score for the first five tests is:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Therefore, he needs to score:
558 - 438 = 120

This means Brinley needs to score at least 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.
False: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Brinley's total points for the first 5 tests without dropping the lowest score: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

2. To find out the score he needs on the sixth test, we can set up an equation:
(438 - x) / 5 = 93

Where x is the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.

3. Solving for x:
(438 - x) = 93 * 5
438 - x = 465
-x = 465 - 438
-x = 27
x = -27

Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 27 points on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 for the semester.
False: To find out what score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93, we can calculate the current sum of his first five test scores and subtract the lowest score. 

(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 438

Now, we subtract the lowest score (71) to get:

438 - 71 = 367

To achieve an average of 93 across all six tests, Brinley's total score needs to be 93 * 6 = 558. 

To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract his current total score from the desired total score:

558 - 367 = 191

Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 191 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

Later, her husband also bought a pack of 5 new spoons and gave them to Juliet. When Juliet was taste-testing the stew, she used 3 spoons. Later, when she was setting up the cutlery, there were a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the pack Juliet bought?
GT : 10
False:  Juliet originally bought a pack of 5 plastic spoons. Her husband also bought a pack of 5 spoons, so together they had 10 spoons. Juliet used 3 spoons for taste-testing, so there were 7 spoons left. When she was setting up the cutlery, there were a total of 12 spoons. This means that Juliet must have used one spoon from her original pack of 5, and the other 4 were from her husband's pack. So, the pack Juliet bought initially contained 5 spoons.
False:  Juliet bought a pack of 7 spoons. 

Explanation:
- Juliet bought a pack of spoons, so initially, she had 7 spoons.
- Her husband bought 5 spoons, making the total number of spoons in the house 7 + 5 = 12.
- Juliet used 3 spoons for taste-testing, so the pack she bought originally contained 7 spoons.
False:  Juliet originally bought a pack with 5 spoons. Her husband also bought a pack of 5 spoons, so together they had 10 spoons. Juliet used 3 spoons for taste-testing, leaving 7 spoons. Therefore, the pack that Juliet bought originally contained 5 spoons.
5.0 - 0: Juliet originally bought a pack of 5 spoons. Her husband bought 5 more spoons. So, in total, they had 5 + 5 = 10 spoons. Juliet used 3 spoons later, so the total is X. Therefore, we can write the following equation: <code> 10 - 3 = X  X = 7 </code> The answer is 7.
7.0 - 0: Juliet started with 7 spoons from the pack she bought. Her husband bought 5 more spoons, making a total of 12 spoons. After using 3 spoons for taste-testing, she had a total of 'X' spoons left. <code> 12 - 3 = X  X = 9 </code> The answer is 9.

Q: Chad ordered a custom wrap for lunch. The base wrap costs $6.50. He added $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and 2 sauces at $0.25 each. He decided to spend an additional $3.00 to upgrade his meal with fries and a drink. He has a $5.00 gift card to use at checkout. How much more does he need to pay?
GT : 9
True: The total cost of Chad's custom wrap is:

Base wrap: $6.50
Meat: $2.00
Cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
Sauces (2 @ $0.25 each): $0.50

Total for wrap: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Upgrade with fries and a drink: $3.00

Total before gift card: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Using the $5.00 gift card: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad needs to pay $9.00 more at checkout.
False: The total cost of Chad's custom wrap is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + ($0.25 x 2) = $10.00

Adding the upgrade for fries and a drink brings the total cost to $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

After using the $5.00 gift card, Chad still needs to pay $13.00 - $5.00 = $8.00

Chad needs to pay an additional $8.00.
True: The total cost of the custom wrap before the gift card is $6.50 (base wrap) + $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.50 (sauces) + $3.00 (upgrade) = $14.00

After applying the $5.00 gift card, Chad still needs to pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad needs to pay $9.00 more to complete his purchase.
9.0 - 0: Chad's total cost for the wrap and extras is: Base wrap cost: $6.50 Meat: $2.00 Cheese: $1.00 Avocado: $1.00 Sauces (2*$0.25): $0.50 Upgrade with fries and drink: $3.00 Total cost without gift card: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00  Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is: Total cost - Gift card amount $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00  Therefore, the answer is $9.00.
8.0 - 0: Let's break down Chad's expenses: Base wrap: $6.50 Meat: $2.00 Cheese: $1.00 Avocado: $1.00 Sauces: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50 Upgrade with fries and drink: $3.00 Total cost before using gift card: 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = $14.00 After using the $5.00 gift card, Chad needs to pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00  Therefore, the answer is $9.00.

Q: Carlos and Benji were at the beach. Carlos rented a canoe at a rate of $30 per hour, and Benji rented a banana boat raft at a rate of $18 per hour. If Carlos used the boat for 3 hours and Benji used the raft for 5 hours, how much did they pay in total for the rentals?
GT : 180
True: Carlos paid $30 x 3 = $90 for renting the canoe for 3 hours.
Benji paid $18 x 5 = $90 for renting the banana boat raft for 5 hours.
Therefore, Carlos and Benji paid a total of $90 + $90 = $180 for the rentals.
True: Carlos:
3 hours x $30/hour = $90

Benji:
5 hours x $18/hour = $90

Total cost:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

They paid a total of $180 for the rentals.
True: Carlos paid $30/hour * 3 hours = $90 for the canoe rental.
Benji paid $18/hour * 5 hours = $90 for the banana boat raft rental.
In total, they paid $90 + $90 = $180 for the rentals.

Q: There are 4 birds in a birdhouse. Sally No.2 is 3 years older than Grandma Red. Grandma Red's age is twice that of Sally No.4. If Sally No.4 and Sally No.32 are the same age, and Sally No.32 is 8 years old, how old are the 4 birds combined?
GT : 51
True: First, we need to determine the ages of the other birds based on the information provided.

Since Sally No.32 is 8 years old, and Sally No.32 is the same age as Sally No.4, then Sally No.4 is also 8 years old.

Grandma Red's age is twice that of Sally No.4, so Grandma Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally No.2 is 3 years older than Grandma Red, so Sally No.2 is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the 4 birds combined by adding up their ages:
8 (Sally No.4) + 16 (Grandma Red) + 19 (Sally No.2) + 8 (Sally No.32) = 51 years old

Therefore, the 4 birds combined are 51 years old.
True: First, we need to find the ages of Grandma Red and Sally No.2:

Sally No.32 is 8 years old, so Sally No.4 is also 8 years old.

So, Grandma Red's age is twice that of Sally No.4, which means she is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally No.2 is 3 years older than Grandma Red, so she is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all 4 birds:

8 (Sally No.4) + 16 (Grandma Red) + 19 (Sally No.2) + 8 (Sally No.32) = 51 years

Therefore, the combined age of the 4 birds is 51 years.
True: To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Grandma Red, Sally No.2, and Sally No.4 first.

Since Sally No.32 is 8 years old, and Sally No.32 is the same age as Sally No.4, we know that Sally No.4 is also 8 years old.

Therefore, Grandma Red's age is twice that of Sally No.4, which means Grandma Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

And since Sally No.2 is 3 years older than Grandma Red, Sally No.2 is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now we can calculate the sum of the ages of all 4 birds:

8 (Sally No.4) + 16 (Grandma Red) + 19 (Sally No.2) + 8 (Sally No.32) = 51 years

The 4 birds combined are 51 years old.

True: Jessa is 20 years old, so Joan is 25 years old (Jessa's age plus 5 years) and Mary is 23 years old (Joan's age minus 2 years). 
The total age of the three girls is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years old.
True: Jessa is 20 years old.
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so she is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so she is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.
The total age of the three girls is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years old.
True: Jessa is 20 years old.
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20+5=25 years old.
Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25-2=23 years old.
The total age of the three girls is 20+25+23=68 years.

Q: In a fleet of 20 rental cars, there are 12 automatic cars, 4 manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic cars. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic?
GT : 20
True: There are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars, leaving 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars in the fleet is (4/20) * 100% = 20%. 

Therefore, 20% of the cars in the fleet are semi-automatic.
True: There are 20 total cars in the fleet, with 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars in the fleet, we can use the formula:

( Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars ) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:

( 4 / 20 ) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the cars in the fleet are semi-automatic cars.
True: There are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars, so the total number of automatic and manual cars is 12+4 = 16 cars.
This means that there are 20-16 = 4 semi-automatic cars in the fleet.

To find the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic, we can divide the number of semi-automatic cars (4) by the total number of cars in the fleet (20) and multiply by 100:

(4/20) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the cars in the fleet are semi-automatic cars.

Q: Nisha hired 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Christmas village. One-third of the elves quit after children vomited on them, and then 10 more elves quit after being kicked in the shins by children. How many elves are left?
GT : 30
False: There are 30 elves left after one-third quit and then 10 more quit, leaving 20 elves remaining in Nisha's department store.
True:  There were 60 seasonal workers, so 1/3 of them quit after being vomited on: 60 workers / 3 = 20 workers
Then 10 more quit after being kicked in the shins, so the total number of workers who quit is 20 workers + 10 workers = 30 workers
Subtracting the workers who quit from the total number of workers gives us 60 workers - 30 workers = 30 elves left. 
Therefore, there are 30 elves left.
True: There were 40 seasonal workers left after one-third of them quit, and then 10 more quit, leaving 30 elves in total.
20.0 - 0: Nisha originally hired 60 seasonal workers as elves. One-third of them quit, leaving: <code> 60 - (1/3 * 60) = 60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining </code> If 'X' more elves quit after being kicked in the shins, and there are 20 elves left, we can write the following equation: <code> 40 - X = 20  X = 40 - 20  X = 20 </code> The answer is 20.
30.0 - 6: Nisha originally hired 60 seasonal workers. One-third of them quit, which is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. And then X more elves quit after being kicked in the shins. So, the equation is: <code> 60 - 20 - X = 30  40 - X = 30  X = 40 - 30  X = 10 </code>  The answer is 10.

Unfortunately, someone made a mistake, Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 2 fruit roll-ups wide and 24 fruit roll-ups long, while Mashelle's fruit roll-up is 3 fruit roll-ups wide and 14 fruit roll-ups long. If they both finish all their fruit roll-ups, how many did they eat on average?
GT : 45
True: Beatrice ate a total of 2 * 24 = 48 fruit roll-ups.
Mashelle ate a total of 3 * 14 = 42 fruit roll-ups.
Combined, they ate 48 + 42 = 90 fruit roll-ups.
On average, they each ate 90 / 2 = 45 fruit roll-ups.
True: First, find the total number of fruit roll-ups each person has:
Beatrice: 2 width x 24 length = 48 fruit roll-ups
Mashelle: 3 width x 14 length = 42 fruit roll-ups

Total fruit roll-ups eaten: 48 (Beatrice) + 42 (Mashelle) = 90 fruit roll-ups

Now, find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person:
Total fruit roll-ups / 2 people = 90 / 2 = 45 fruit roll-ups

Each person ate an average of 45 fruit roll-ups.
True: First, let's find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Beatrice:
2 roll-ups wide x 24 roll-ups long = 48 fruit roll-ups

Next, let's find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Mashelle:
3 roll-ups wide x 14 roll-ups long = 42 fruit roll-ups

Now, let's find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both of them:
48 fruit roll-ups + 42 fruit roll-ups = 90 fruit roll-ups

Now, let's find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both of them:
90 fruit roll-ups / 2 people = 45 fruit roll-ups

Therefore, on average, they each ate 45 fruit roll-ups.

Q: John won an award at work. The award includes a cash prize equal to 1 times 5,000 dollars and a 5% raise. If he earns 2,000 dollars every week (every week of the year), and he won the award on the first day of the year, how much does he earn that year?
GT : 114,200
False: First, let's calculate the cash prize John received:
Cash prize = 1 * $5,000 = $5,000

Next, let's calculate the raise he received:
Raise = 5% of $2,000 = 0.05 * $2,000 = $100
Total raise for the year = $100 * 52 weeks = $5,200

Now, let's calculate John's total earnings for the year, including the cash prize and raise:
Total earnings = $5,000 (cash prize) + $5,200 (raise) + ($2,000 * 52 weeks) = $5,000 + $5,200 + $104,000 = $114,200

Therefore, John earned $114,200 that year.
False: First, let's calculate the cash prize John received. 
Cash prize = 1 times $5,000 = $5,000

Next, let's calculate John's new weekly salary after the 5% raise.
New weekly salary = $2,000 + (5% of $2,000)
New weekly salary = $2,000 + (0.05 * $2,000)
New weekly salary = $2,000 + $100
New weekly salary = $2,100

Now, let's calculate how much John earns in a year with his new weekly salary.
Weekly earnings = $2,100
Yearly earnings = $2,100 * 52 weeks
Yearly earnings = $109,200

Adding the cash prize John won at the beginning of the year:
Total earnings for the year = $109,200 + $5,000
Total earnings for the year = $114,200

Therefore, John earns $114,200 that year after winning the award at work.
False: First, let's calculate the cash prize John received:

Cash prize = 5,000 * 1 = 5,000 dollars

Now, let's calculate John's annual salary increase:

Annual raise = 2,000 * 0.05 = 100 dollars

Now, let's calculate John's total earnings per week after the raise:

Total weekly earnings = 2,000 + 100 = 2,100 dollars

Since John won the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year:

Total annual earnings = Total weekly earnings * 52 weeks = 2,100 * 52 = 109,200 dollars

Adding the cash prize:

Total annual earnings = 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200 dollars

Therefore, John earns 114,200 dollars that year.

Q: Deborah is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees enter and leave in a day. She saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, then she saw half that number return in the next 6 hours. She saw twice the number she first saw leave the hive and leave in the following 6 hours. Then, each bee that had previously left and not yet returned came back to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Deborah see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?
GT : 75
False: To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

- 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.
- Half that number, so 30/2 = 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours.
- Twice the number of bees that initially left, so 30*2 = 60 bees left in the following 6 hours.
- All bees that had left and not yet returned came back to the hive in the last 6 hours.

So, in the last 6 hours, a total of 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees returned to the hive.
False: In the first 6 hours, Deborah saw 30 bees leave the hive.

In the next 6 hours, she saw half that number return, so 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned to the hive.

In the following 6 hours, she saw twice the number she first saw leave the hive leave, so 30 x 2 = 60 bees left the hive.

In the next 6 hours, each bee that had previously left and not yet returned came back to the hive, so 60 bees returned to the hive.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours of the day, Deborah saw 60 bees return to the hive.
False: In the first 6 hours, Deborah saw 30 bees leave the hive.
In the next 6 hours, half of that number returned, so 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned.
In the following 6 hours, twice the number that initially left the hive left again, so 30 x 2 = 60 bees left.
Therefore, in the last 6 hours of the day, all the bees that had previously left and not yet returned came back, so 60 bees returned to the hive.
105.0 - 3: Let's break down the information given step by step: 1. 30 bees left the hive in the first X hours. 2. Half that number (15 bees) returned in the next X hours. 3. Twice the number that left initially (60 bees) left in the following X hours. 4. All the bees that left but had not yet returned came back in the next X hours.  Now, we know that 105 bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. So, the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is: 30 (initial bees that left) + 15 (bees that returned) + 60 (additional bees that left) + X (initial bees that did not return) = 105  <code> 30 + 15 + 60 + X = 105  105 + X = 105  X = 0 </code>  Therefore, the answer is 0.
60.0 - 2: Let's break down the information given: - Deborah saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first X hours. - She saw half that number, so 15 bees, return in the next X hours. - She saw twice the number, so 60 bees, leave the hive in the following X hours. - Each bee that had previously left and not yet returned came back in the next X hours. - Deborah saw 60.0 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.  Let's set up the equations to solve for X: 1. Bees leave the hive in the first X hours: 30 bees 2. Bees return in the next X hours: 15 bees 3. Bees leave the hive again: 60 bees 4. Bees return in the next X hours: 30 bees 5. Bees return in the last 6 hours: 60 bees  Putting it all together: <code> 30 + 15 + 60 + 30 + 60 = 60.0 135 = 60.0 </code>  Since the equation doesn't make sense, please check the data given or provide additional information.

Q: Brian's friend Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5. If Brian had 20 video games but lost 5 just before the comparison, how many does Bobby have?
GT : 40
True: Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games before the comparison.
Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5, so Bobby has 3 * 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 video games.
False: Before losing 5 video games, Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
Therefore, Bobby has (15/3) - 5 = 5 video games.
False: If Brian had 20 video games but lost 5 before the comparison, he currently has 15 video games. 

Since Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5, he has 3 * 15 = 45 games. 

Therefore, Bobby currently has 45 video games.
40.0 - 2: Let's break down the information given. Bobby has 40 video games, which is 3 times fewer than Brian minus 5 video games. So we can write the equation as follows:  \(40 = 3(X-5)\)  Now, we also know that Brian originally had X video games but lost 5, so he actually had \(X-5\) video games at the time of comparison. Putting it all together:  \(40 = 3(X-5)\)   \(40 = 3X - 15\)   \(55 = 3X\)   \(X = 18.33\)  Since the number of video games cannot be a decimal, we can conclude Brian originally had 18 video games.
5.0 - 3: Brian originally had X video games. Before the comparison, Brian lost 5 video games. So, Brian had X - 5 video games. Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5, which means Bobby has (X - 5)/3 video games. If Bobby has 5 video games, we can write the following equation: <code>(X - 5)/3 = 5 X - 5 = 15 X = 20 </code> Therefore, the answer is 20.
45.0 - 1: Let's break down the information given: - Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian minus 5: This means Bobby has (Brian - 5)/3 video games. - If Brian had X video games but lost 5 just before the comparison: This means Brian originally had X + 5 video games. - Bobby has 45 items: This means (Brian - 5)/3 = 45.  Now, we can set up the equation: <code> (X + 5)/3 = 45  X + 5 = 45 * 3  X + 5 = 135  X = 135 - 5  X = 130 </code>  Therefore, the answer is 130.

Q: James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards. If he lost 8 water-type cards and bought 14 grass-type cards, what is the probability (rounded to the nearest whole number) that a randomly chosen card is water-type?
GT : 33
False: Initially, James had a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.
After losing 8 water-type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards.
After buying 14 grass-type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards.
So the total number of cards James has now is 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.

The probability of choosing a water-type card is 32 / 96 = 1/3 = 33.33% (rounded to the nearest whole number).
True: First, we need to adjust the number of water-type and grass-type cards after James lost 8 water-type cards and bought 14 grass-type cards.

After losing 8 water-type cards, James now has 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards.
After buying 14 grass-type cards, James now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards.

Now, we can calculate the total number of Pokémon cards James has:
30 (fire-type) + 32 (water-type) + 34 (grass-type) = 96 cards.

The probability of choosing a water-type card randomly is the number of water-type cards divided by the total number of cards:
32 water-type cards / 96 total cards = 1/3 = 33% (rounded to the nearest whole number). 

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen card is water-type is 33%.
False: The total number of cards James has after losing 8 water-type cards and buying 14 grass-type cards is:

30 fire-type + 20 grass-type + (40 water-type - 8 lost + 14 bought) = 76 cards

The probability of choosing a water-type card is the number of water-type cards divided by the total number of cards:

32 water-type cards / 76 total cards = 0.42

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the probability of choosing a water-type card is 42%.
33.33 - 0: James originally had X water-type cards. After losing 8 water-type cards and buying 14 grass-type cards, the total number of water-type cards is X - 8. The total number of cards is 30 + 20 + X - 8 = 50 + X - 8 = 42 + X.   The probability of choosing a water-type card is (X - 8) / (42 + X), and since this probability is 33% when rounded to the nearest whole number, we can write it as (X - 8) / (42 + X) = 0.33.  Solving for X: (X - 8) / (42 + X) = 0.33 X - 8 = 0.33(42 + X) X - 8 = 13.86 + 0.33X 0.67X = 21.86 X = 21.86 / 0.67 X = 32.6  Therefore, the answer is X = 32 (rounded to the nearest whole number).
33.0 - 0: James originally had X water-type cards. After losing 8, he had X - 8 water-type cards. And after buying 14 grass-type cards, the total number of cards became: 30 (fire-type) + 20 (grass-type) + (X - 8) (water-type) + 14 (bought grass-type) = Total cards  According to the given probability, the number of water-type cards should be equal to 33% of the total number of cards. So, we can write the following equation: X - 8 = 0.33 * (30 + 20 + X - 8 + 14)  Solving this equation will give us the value of X: X - 8 = 0.33 * (72 + X) X - 8 = 23.76 + 0.33X 0.67X = 31.76 X = 47.49  So, the answer for X is approximately 47.
42.0 - 0: James originally had X water-type cards. After losing 8 water-type cards and buying 14 grass-type cards, we can calculate the total number of cards he has: <code>X (water-type) + 30 (fire-type) + 20 (grass-type) = Total number of cards X + 30 + 20 = Total number of cards X + 50 = Total number of cards</code>  The probability of choosing a water-type card is 42%, so we can write the following equation: <code>X / (X + 50) = 0.42</code>  Solving this equation will give us the value of X: <code>X / (X + 50) = 0.42 X = 0.42(X + 50) X = 0.42X + 21 X - 0.42X = 21 0.58X = 21 X = 21 / 0.58 X ≈ 36.21</code>  Therefore, the answer is approximately 36 water-type cards.

Q: Bill makes 300 bread rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes daily. Each bread roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill connects all the breads end to end, how long would they be in total?
GT : 280
False: To find the total length of all the bread, we first need to calculate the length of each type of bread:

- Bread rolls: 300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Chocolate croissants: 120 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes x 2 feet x 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, add up all the lengths:
Total length = 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Therefore, all the bread would be 3360 inches long in total when connected end to end.
False: First, we need to calculate the total length of the bread rolls, chocolate croissants, and baguettes separately.

Total length of bread rolls:
300 bread rolls * 4 inches = 1200 inches

Total length of chocolate croissants:
120 croissants * 6 inches = 720 inches

Total length of baguettes:
60 baguettes * 24 inches (2 feet = 24 inches) = 1440 inches

Now, add up the total length of all the breads:
1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Therefore, all the breads, when connected end to end, would be a total of 3360 inches long.
False: To find the total length of all the breads, we first need to convert the measurements to a common unit. 2 feet is equal to 24 inches.

300 bread rolls x 4 inches = 1200 inches
120 chocolate croissants x 6 inches = 720 inches
60 baguettes x 24 inches = 1440 inches

Total length = 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Therefore, if Bill connects all the breads end to end, they would be 3360 inches long in total.

GT : 12
True: There are 12 penguins still sunbathing. 

Since one-third of the penguins jumped into the sea to swim (36 / 3 = 12 penguins), and another third went into the cave to feed (36 / 3 = 12 penguins), there are 12 penguins left sunbathing (36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins).
True: There are 12 penguins still sunbathing. 

1/3 of 36 penguins (12 penguins) jumped into the sea to swim.
Another 1/3 of 36 penguins (12 penguins) went into the cave to feed.

So, 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins are still sunbathing.
True: There are 12 penguins still sunbathing, as one third (12) jumped into the sea and another third (12) went into the cave.

Q: Dylan needs chicken sausages and fish sausages to make sausage rolls for a party. He bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. How many sausages did Dylan buy in total?
GT : 82
True: Let's say the number of fish sausages Dylan bought is x.

He bought 38 chicken sausages.

According to the given information, x = 38 + 6
x = 44

So, Dylan bought 44 fish sausages and 38 chicken sausages.

In total, Dylan bought 44 + 38 = 82 sausages.
True: Let x be the number of fish sausages Dylan bought.

Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is x = 38 + 6 = 44.

Total number of sausages Dylan bought = 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages.

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.
True: Let x be the number of fish sausages Dylan bought. 

So, Dylan bought a total of 38 + x chicken sausages and x fish sausages. 

We know that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so:
x = 38 + 6
x = 44

Therefore, Dylan bought 38 + 44 = 82 sausages in total.

GT : 30
True: Together, the cost of one child ticket and one adult ticket is $12 + $10 = $22.
If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 + $8 = $30.
True: Let x be the amount Brittany's mom paid.

12 + 10 = 22 (Total cost for one adult and one child ticket)

x - 22 = 8 (Change received)

x = 22 + 8
x = 30

Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.
True: To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to first calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost of one adult ticket is $12 and the cost of one child ticket is $10. 
So, the total cost of one adult ticket and one child ticket is $12 + $10 = $22.

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have paid $22 + $8 = $30.

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30 for the tickets.

GT : 105
True: Mark answered 5 questions per hour, so for the first test, he answered 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.
Therefore, he did not answer 75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions on the first test.
For the second test, he answered 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.
Therefore, he did not answer 100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions on the second test.
Therefore, Mark did not answer a total of 35 questions + 70 questions = 105 questions.
True: Mark answered 5 questions per hour, so in 8 hours he answered 8 * 5 = 40 questions on the first test.
Therefore, he did not answer 75 - 40 = 35 questions on the first test.
For the second test, he answered 5 questions per hour, so in 6 hours he answered 6 * 5 = 30 questions.

Q: Johnny is picking up toys from the floor of his room. He dumped a set of 500-piece Legos, another set that is three times larger than the 500-piece set, and a set that is only a quarter of the size of the larger set. If Johnny is to pick up all the Legos, how many pieces must he pick up?
GT : 2125
False: Let x be the size of the 500-piece Lego set.
The second set is 3x in size.
The third set is 1/4 * 3x = 3/4x in size.

Total pieces = 500 + 3x + 3/4x
Total pieces = 500 + 3x + 3/4 * x
Total pieces = 500 + 3x + 0.75x
Total pieces = 3.75x + 500

If Johnny is to pick up all the Legos, he must pick up a total of 3.75x + 500 pieces.
False: Let's break it down:
500-piece set
3 times larger set = 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces
Quarter size of the larger set = 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces

Total pieces = 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces

Johnny must pick up 2375 Lego pieces.
False: Let's break it down step by step:

500-piece set of Legos: 500 pieces
Three times larger set: 500 x 3 = 1500 pieces
Quarter of the larger set: 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces

Total pieces to pick up:
500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces

Johnny must pick up a total of 2375 Lego pieces.
500.0 - 0: Let's break this down step by step:  1. Johnny dumped a set of X-piece Legos. 2. Another set is three times larger than the X-piece set, so it has 3X pieces. 3. A third set is a quarter of the size of the larger set, so it has (3X)/4 pieces.  In total, Johnny must pick up X + 3X + (3X)/4 = 500 pieces of Legos.  Combining the terms, we get:  <code>X + 3X + \frac{3X}{4} = 500 \frac{16X}{4} + \frac{9X}{4} = 500 \frac{25X}{4} = 500 25X = 2000 X = \frac{2000}{25} X = 80</code>  Therefore, the answer is 80.
2375.0 - 4: Let's break down the problem into mathematical equations. Let's denote the number of pieces in the X-piece Lego set as X.  The total number of pieces Johnny needs to pick up can be expressed as: X (original set) + 3X (larger set) + 0.25(3X) (smaller set) = 2375.0  Solving the equation: X + 3X + 0.75X = 2375.0 4X = 2375.0 X = 2375.0 / 4 X = 593.75  Therefore, the answer is X = 593.75. Since we can't have a fraction of Lego pieces, we can round down to the nearest whole number. So, the answer would be X = 593.

GT : 360
True: John pays $360 in total. 

Calculation: 2 pairs of shoes x $60 per pair = $120 per child
$120 per child x 3 children = $360 total.
False:  The total cost for each child is $60 x 2 = $120.
So, John pays $120 x 3 = $360 for 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children.
False: John pays $360 in total for the 2 pairs of shoes for each of the 3 children.
360.0 - 5: John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of 3 children, so in total he buys 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so 6 pairs cost 6 * $60 = $360. The total amount paid is $360, so: X = $360.
3.0 - 3: John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes in total. Each pair costs $60, so the total cost is 6 x 60 = $360. He pays $30, so the remaining balance is X. <code> 360 - 30 = X  X = 330 </code> The answer is $330.

Q: In a beehive with 700 bees, the number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae, and the number of larvae is twice the number of queen bees. How many worker bees are there?
GT : 400
True: Let's denote the number of queen bees as Q, the number of larvae as L, and the number of worker bees as W.

Given that there are 700 bees in total, we have:

Q + L + W = 700

We are also given that the number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae:

W = 2L

And that the number of larvae is twice the number of queen bees:

L = 2Q

Substitute L = 2Q into W = 2L:

W = 2(2Q)
W = 4Q

Now substitute W = 4Q and L = 2Q into Q + L + W = 700:

Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now we can find the number of worker bees:

W = 4Q
W = 4(100)
W = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the beehive.
True: Let the number of queen bees be x.

Then the number of larvae is 2x, and the number of worker bees is 4x.

Now, the total number of bees in the hive is given as 700:

x + 2x + 4x = 700
7x = 700

Now, solve for x:

x = 100

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

4x = 4(100) = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees in the beehive.
True: Let's represent the number of queen bees as Q, the number of larvae as L, and the number of worker bees as W.

Given that the number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae, we have W = 2L.
And the number of larvae is twice the number of queen bees, so L = 2Q.

Since we know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, we can write the equation:
Q + L + W = 700

Substitute the expressions for L and W in terms of Q into the equation:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2L
W = 2(2Q)
W = 2(2*100)
W = 2(200)
W = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the beehive.

False: Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, which means he eats 42 tomatoes in a week (6 x 7 = 42). 

If a vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, Steve would need 14 vines to meet his cherry tomato consumption (42 / 3 = 14).

GT : 276,000
False: First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars without taxes and registration fees:
12 cars * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, let's calculate the total tax paid:
10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the total registration fees paid:
12 cars * $1,000 = $12,000

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, Mark spent a total of $276,000 for the fleet of cars.
False: First, calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees: 
12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000

Next, calculate the total tax paid on the cars:
$240,000 * 10% = $24,000

Now, calculate the total registration fees paid for all 12 cars:
12 cars * $1,000/car = $12,000

Finally, add the cost of the cars, tax, and registration fees to find the total amount spent:
$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Mark spent a total of $276,000 on the fleet of cars for his company.
False: The total cost of the cars before tax was $20,000 x 12 = $240,000.
The total tax paid was 10% of $240,000 = $24,000.
The total registration fees paid were $1,000 x 12 = $12,000.
Therefore, the total amount spent by Mark was $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

True: There are 240 - 80 = 160 Chinese participants in the competition.
If the Chinese team has 60 male members, then there are 160 - 60 = 100 female members in the Chinese team.
False: There are 160 Chinese members in total at the competition (240 total Asians - 80 Japanese).
Since there are 60 male Chinese members, there must be 100 female Chinese members (160 total Chinese members - 60 male Chinese members).
100.0 - 8: There are 240 Asians in total, with 80 being Japanese. So the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160. Let's denote the number of male Chinese members as X. Given that there are 100 female Chinese members, the total number of Chinese members is X + 100.  Therefore, we can write the equation: X + 100 = 160  Solving for X: X = 160 - 100 X = 60  So, the answer is 60.
60.0 - 0: There are 240 Asians in total. If 80 are Japanese, then the remaining are Chinese. Let's denote the number of male members in the Chinese team as X.

Q: A band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform consists of a hat, jacket, and trousers, with each hat costing 25 dollars, each jacket costing three times the price of a hat, and each pair of trousers costing the average price of a hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost in total?
GT : 150
False: Let's denote the cost of the hat as H, the cost of the jacket as J, and the cost of the trousers as T.

Given that each hat costs $25, we have H = $25.

Since each jacket costs three times the price of a hat, we have J = 3H = 3($25) = $75.

And since each pair of trousers costs the average price of a hat and jacket, we have T = (H + J) / 2 = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50 / 2 = $25.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is H + J + T = $25 + $75 + $25 = $125.

So, each uniform costs a total of $125.
True: Let's represent the cost of a hat, jacket, and trousers as variables:

Hat cost = $25
Jacket cost = 3 * $25 = $75
Trousers cost = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Total cost of uniform = Hat cost + Jacket cost + Trousers cost
Total cost of uniform = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

Therefore, each uniform costs $150 in total.
True: Let x be the cost of the hat.

The cost of the jacket is 3x.

The cost of the trousers is (x + 3x) / 2 = 2x.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:

x + 3x + 2x = 6x

Since the hat costs 25 dollars:

25 = x

So x = 25.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:

6(25) = 150 dollars. 

Each uniform costs a total of 150 dollars.
125.0 - 0: Let's break down the total cost of each uniform: - Hat: X dollars - Jacket: 3X dollars - Trousers: (X + 3X) / 2 = 2X dollars  The total cost is: X + 3X + 2X = $125 6X = $125 X = $125 / 6 X = $20.83  So, the answer is $20.83.
150.0 - 2: The total cost of each uniform is $150, which consists of a hat (X dollars), a jacket (3X dollars), and trousers (average of hat and jacket). So, we can write the following equation: <code>X + 3X + (X + 3X) / 2 = 150 5X + (4X) / 2 = 150 5X + 2X = 150 7X = 150 X = 150 / 7 X ≈ 21.43</code> So, the answer is approximately $21.43.

Q: Sandra, the owner of a florist shop around the corner, is very dissatisfied with Fred for not completing the order delivery. The number of red roses Sandra ordered is four times the number of white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink lotuses, which is five times the number of white carnations. Sandra threatens to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 PM. How many red roses must Fred deliver before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business?
GT : 160
False: Fred must deliver 80 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business. 

Explanation:
Let the number of white carnations be x.
Number of red roses = 4x
Number of pink lotuses = 5x

Given:
4x + 5x + x = 285 (total order)
10x = 285
x = 28.5

Since x cannot be a decimal value, assume x = 29.

Number of red roses = 4(29) = 116
Number of pink lotuses = 5(29) = 145
Number of white carnations = 29

Total order = 116 + 145 + 29 = 290

Fred must deliver 80 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business.
True: Fred must deliver 16 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business. 
This is because:
- Sandra ordered four times the number of red roses of white carnations, so if we let the number of white carnations be x, then the number of red roses is 4x.
- Sandra ordered 200 pink lotuses, which is five times the number of white carnations, so 200 = 5x, which means x = 40.
- Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is 4 * 40 = 160.
- If Fred delivers 160 red roses as ordered, Sandra will retain her business.
False: Fred must deliver 80 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business. 

Let x be the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. 
Then, the number of red roses ordered is 4x. 
And the number of pink lotuses ordered is 200. 

So, we have the equations: 
4x = 80 (since Sandra ordered 4 times the number of white carnations) 
200 = 5x (since Sandra ordered 5 times the number of white carnations) 

Solving the second equation, we get: 
5x = 200 
x = 40 

Plugging x back into the first equation, we get: 
4(40) = 80 

Therefore, Fred must deliver 80 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business.
5.0 - 2: Let's denote the number of white carnations as W. From the information given, we know that: Number of red roses = 4W Number of pink lotuses = 5W  Sandra ordered 200 pink lotuses, so: 5W = 200 W = 40  Now we can find the number of red roses ordered: Number of red roses = 4W = 4(40) = 160  Fred needs to deliver 5 red roses before 5 PM, so he needs to deliver 160 - 5 = 155 red roses by X PM.  Since Sandra threatens to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by X PM, X PM would be the deadline for Fred to deliver the remaining 155 red roses.  Therefore, the answer is 155.
160.0 - 4: Let's break down the information given: - The number of red roses ordered = 4 times the number of white carnations - The number of pink lotuses ordered = 5 times the number of white carnations - Sandra ordered 200 pink lotuses  So, if we let the number of white carnations be represented by W: - Number of red roses = 4W - Number of pink lotuses = 5W - Number of pink lotuses ordered = 200  Since Sandra threatens to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by X PM, and Fred must deliver 160 red roses before 5 PM to retain Sandra's business, we have: - Number of red roses delivered = 160  Now, we can set up the equation for the red roses: 4W = 160 W = 40  Since Sandra ordered 200 pink lotuses which is 5 times the number of white carnations, we have: 5W = 200 5(40) = 200  Therefore, Fred must deliver the missing red roses by 5 PM. So, the answer of 'X' would be 5.

Q: Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri's score was 10 more than half of Naomi's, and Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?
GT : 54
True: Let's break it down one step at a time.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri's score was 10 more than half of Naomi's, which means Yuri scored (68/2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Now, we know that the four students scored a total of 251 points. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we do:
Total points - (Naomi + Yuri + Brianna) = Jojo's points
251 - 197 = 54 points

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points in the board game.
True: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri's score was 10 more than half of Naomi's: Half of Naomi's score is 68/2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
4. The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.
5. The total points scored by all four students is 251 points.
6. Therefore, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

Jojo scored 54 points.
True: Let's first find out how many points Yuri scored.
Half of Naomi's score is 68/2 = 34 points.
Therefore, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Brianna scored.
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we add up the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna to find out how many points Jojo scored.
Naomi + Yuri + Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can subtract the total score of the three students from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.
251 - 197 = 54 points

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

Q: Sati slept 8 hours on Monday. The next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day because she had to complete some tasks. If for the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total during the week?
GT : 48
False: Sati slept 8 hours on Monday. On Tuesday, she slept 6 hours (2 hours less than Monday), and on Wednesday, she slept 4 hours (2 hours less than Tuesday).

For the rest of the week, she slept 5 hours each day (1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday).

Therefore, during the whole week, she slept:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 38 hours in total.
False: Sati slept 8 hours on Monday, then 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday, and 6 - 2 = 4 hours on Wednesday.
For the rest of the week, she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours per day.
So for the rest of the week, she slept 5 * 5 = 25 hours.
Therefore, during the week, Sati slept a total of 8 + 6 + 4 + 25 = 43 hours.
False: First, let's find out how many hours Sati slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.

On Tuesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours each day.

In total, Sati slept 8 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 4 (Wednesday) + 5 (Thursday) + 5 (Friday) + 5 (Saturday) + 5 (Sunday) = 38 hours during the week.
38.0 - 0: Sati slept 8 hours on Monday, then 2 hours less each day on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept for 8 - 2 - 2 = 4 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. Let's say she slept X hours for the rest of the week. Therefore, the total sleep hours for the entire week can be expressed as: \[ 8\text{ hours} + 4\text{ hours} + 4\text{ hours} + X\text{ hours} = 38\text{ hours} \] \[ 16 + X = 38 \] \[ X = 38 - 16 \] \[ X = 22 \] So, the answer for 'X' is 22.
43.0 - 0: On Tuesday and Wednesday, Sati slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. For the rest of the week, she slept X hours more than those two days, so she slept X + 6 hours each day. Adding up all the days, we get: 8 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 6 (Wednesday) + 2X (rest of the week) = 43 20 + 2X = 43 2X = 23 X = 11.5  Therefore, the answer is 11.5.

How much more money would she make if she hires the accountant?
GT : 15
True: If Jackie handles her taxes herself, she would lose 3 hours of freelancing time, resulting in a loss of 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

If she hires the accountant, she would pay a fee of $90.

Therefore, she would make $105 - $90 = $15 more if she hires the accountant.
True: To calculate the difference in earnings, we need to compare the income lost by handling taxes herself with the cost of hiring the accountant.

Income lost by handling taxes herself:
3 hours * $35 per hour = $105

How much money does she have left for clothes?
GT : 77
True: Avila spent a total of 1,090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1,423 euros on the computer and accessories.
She had a budget of 1,500 euros.
Therefore, she has 1,500 - 1,423 = 77 euros left for clothes.
True: Avila spent a total of 1,090 euros + 157 euros + 74 euros + 102 euros = 1,423 euros on the computer and accessories.
She had a budget of 1,500 euros, so she has 1,500 euros - 1,423 euros = 77 euros left for clothes. 
Therefore, Avila has 77 euros left for clothes.
True: To find how much money Avila has left for clothes, we first add up the cost of the computer and accessories:

Computer (1,090 euros) + Scanner (157 euros) + CD burner (74 euros) + Printer (102 euros) = 1,423 euros

Next, we subtract the total cost of the computer and accessories from her budget:

1,500 euros - 1,423 euros = 77 euros

Avila has 77 euros left for clothes after purchasing the computer and accessories.

GT : 50
True: First, let's calculate the price of the doll. Since the price of the doll is equivalent to the price of 3 toy figures, and each toy figure costs $5, the doll is worth 3 * $5 = $15.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars. Since there are 5 toy cars and each costs $4, the total cost of the toy cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

Therefore, the total value of all the toys in the room is $15 (doll) + $20 (toy cars) + $15 (toy figures) = $50.
True: The doll is equivalent to the price of 3 toy figures, so it costs 3 * $5 = $15.
The 5 red toy cars cost 5 * $4 = $20.
So in total, the toys are worth $15 (doll) + $20 (toy cars) + $15 (toy figures) = $50.
True: The cost of the doll is equal to 3 toy figures, so it costs 3 * $5 = $15.
The cost of the 5 toy cars is 5 * $4 = $20.
Therefore, all the toys are worth $15 (doll) + $20 (toy cars) + $15 (toy figures) = $50.

GT : 26
False:  In a week, John drinks 3 glasses of water with breakfast, 3 glasses with lunch, 3 glasses with dinner, and 5 glasses before going to sleep. That adds up to 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 14 glasses of water in a week.
False: On weekdays, John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before going to sleep, so that's 4 glasses of water per day. 

4 glasses x 5 weekdays = 20 glasses of water in a week. 

On weekends, he drinks soda water with dinner, so that's 1 less glass of water on those days. 

20 glasses - 2 glasses = 18 glasses of water in a week. 

Therefore, John drinks 18 glasses of water in a week.
False: 5 glasses of water per weekday (1 with breakfast, 1 with lunch, 1 with dinner, 1 before bed, and 1 before bedtime) x 5 weekdays = 25 glasses of water

Q: The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of a half dozen plates, with each plate priced at $6,000. Calculate the total cost of purchasing each cup.
GT : 145
False: First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Total cost of half a dozen plates = 0.5 * 6,000 = $3,000

Now, calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups:

Total cost of twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 * x, where x is the cost per cup

According to the given information, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, we can set up the equation:

20 * 12 * x = 3,000 - 1,200
240x = 1,800
x = 1,800 / 240
x = $7.50

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing each cup is $7.50.
True: First, calculate the total cost of the half dozen plates:
Total cost of one plate = $6,000
Total cost of half dozen plates = $6,000 x 6 = $36,000

Now, we know that the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of the half dozen plates:
Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36,000 - $1,200 = $34,800

Next, we need to find the total cost of purchasing each cup:
Total cost of one dozen cups = $34,800 / 20 = $1,740
Total cost of one cup = $1,740 / 12 = $145

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing each cup is $145.
True: First, let's calculate the total cost of the half dozen plates:
6 plates x $6,000 per plate = $36,000

Now, let's find the total cost of twenty dozen cups:
20 dozen cups x 12 cups per dozen = 240 cups

Let C be the cost per cup. Thus, the total cost of 240 cups is 240C.

According to the given information, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:

240C = $36,000 - $1,200
240C = $34,800

Now, solve for C to find the cost per cup:
C = $34,800 / 240
C = $145

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing each cup is $145.
7.5 - 0: Let's first calculate the total cost of the half dozen plates: Half dozen = 6 plates Total cost of plates = 6 plates x $6.000 per plate = $36.000  Now, let's calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups: Twenty dozen = 20 x 12 = 240 cups Let the cost of each cup be X. Total cost of cups = 240 cups x X  According to the given information: Total cost of cups = Total cost of plates - $1.200 240X = $36.000 - $1.200 240X = $34.800 X = $34.800 / 240 X = $145  Therefore, the cost of purchasing each cup is $145. Since the answer provided is 7.5, there might have been a mistake in the calculations or the question itself.
145.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given: - Total cost of purchasing twenty dozen cups = X - Total cost of purchasing a half dozen plates = $6.000 (6 plates * $6.000 = $36.000) - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = Total cost of a half dozen plates - $1.200 ($36.000 - $1.200 = $34.800)  Now let's find the cost of purchasing each cup: - In twenty dozen cups, there are 240 cups (20 * 12 = 240) - Cost of purchasing each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups = $34.800 / 240 = $145  Therefore, the answer to the question is $145.

Q: Jen's makeup artist charges $250 per hour. She is starring in a movie that requires very expensive makeup, needing 6 hours a day, and she has makeup 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to shoot. After the shoot, the makeup artist gives Jen a 10% discount because of the heavy workload. How much does Jen pay?
GT : 27000
False: First, calculate the total cost without the discount:
6 hours/day * $250/hour = $1500/day
$1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000/week
$6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000 total

Then calculate the discounted price:
$30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000 discount
$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jen pays $27,000 after the 10% discount.
True: First, calculate the total cost without the discount:
(250 per hour) x 6 hours x 4 days = $6,000 per week
$6,000 x 5 weeks = $30,000 total

Then, calculate the discount Jen receives:
10% of $30,000 = $3,000

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jen pays a total of $27,000 for the makeup services.
True: First, calculate the total cost without the discount: 
6 hours/day * $250/hour = $1500/day
$1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000/week
$6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000 total cost

Apply the 10% discount: 
$30,000 * 0.10 = $3000 discount
$30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

After the discount, Jen pays $27,000.
10.0 - 0: Jen needs makeup 6 hours a day for 'X' days a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to shoot, so the total number of makeup sessions is: X * 6 * 5 = 30X hours. The total cost before the discount is 250 * 30X = 7500X dollars.  After the 10% discount, Jen pays 90% of the total cost which is 0.9 * 7500X = 6750X dollars.  Given that Jen pays 10,000 dollars, we can set up the equation: 6750X = 10000 X = 10000 / 6750 X = 1.48 The answer is approximately 1.48, so Jen has makeup done approximately 1.48 times a week.
27000.0 - 6: Jen needs makeup 6 hours a day for 'X' days a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to shoot. So, the total cost before the discount can be calculated as: <code> Total cost = 250 * 6 * X * 5  Total cost = 7500 * X </code> After the 10% discount, Jen pays $27,000. So, we can write the equation as: <code> 0.9 * 7500 * X = 27000  6750X = 27000  X = 4 </code> The answer is 4. Jen needs makeup 4 times a week.

Q: Gary enjoys walking along the perimeter of the local park, a rectangular park measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many hours does his walk take?
GT : 5
True: To find out how long Gary's walk takes, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks around the park.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all four sides. In this case, the perimeter would be 1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6 = 15 miles.

Now, we can determine how long his walk takes by dividing the total distance by his speed: 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, Gary's walk takes 5 hours.
True: To find the perimeter of the park, we add up all four sides:
Perimeter = 1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6 = 15 miles

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, so the time it takes for his walk is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary's walk around the perimeter of the park takes 5 hours.
True: To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. 

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for Gary to walk this distance, we use the formula speed = distance/time.

3 miles per hour = 15 miles / time
time = 15 miles / 3 miles per hour
time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary's walk around the park takes 5 hours.

10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber at $10 each = 10 * $10 = $100
5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber at $16 each = 5 * $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Now, since the price of wood has risen by 50%, Sasha can sell the lumber at 150% of the original cost.

150% of $180 = 1.5 * $180 = $270

So, if Sasha sells all of the lumber, she will make a profit of $270 - $180 = $90.
True: First, let's calculate the total cost of all the lumber Sasha has:
For the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber:
10 pieces x $10 = $100
For the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber:
5 pieces x $16 = $80
Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the price of wood has risen by 50%, Sasha can now sell the lumber for 150% of its original cost. 
Let's calculate the selling price of all the lumber:
150% of $180 = 1.5 x $180 = $270

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:
Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

Therefore, Sasha would make a profit of $90 if she sells all the lumber.
True: First, let's calculate the original cost of each type of lumber:

For the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber:
10 pieces x $10 each = $100

For the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber:
5 pieces x $16 each = $80

Now, let's calculate the new selling price of each type of lumber after the price increase:

For the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber:
$10 x 1.5 = $15 each

For the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber:
$16 x 1.5 = $24 each

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of each type of lumber:

For the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber:
10 pieces x $15 each = $150

For the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber:
5 pieces x $24 each = $120

Now, let's calculate the total profit Sasha will make:

Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

Total original cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost
Profit = $270 - $180
Profit = $90

Sasha will make a profit of $90 if she sells all of her leftover wood.

Q: A zookeeper feeds all the monkeys in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month, how many bananas does he need to order to last 2 months?
GT : 1400
False: The total number of bananas needed per month is:

200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month

To last for 2 months, he would need to order:

700 bananas per month x 2 months = 1400 bananas 

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last 2 months.
False: The total bananas needed per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas

Bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last 2 months.
False: The zookeeper needs to order:
200 bananas/month + 400 bananas/month + 100 bananas/month = 700 bananas per month.

To last 2 months, he needs to order:
700 bananas/month x 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last 2 months.

GT : 27
True: Morissette brings a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kyle brings twice as many apples as Morissette, so he brings 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kyle also brings half as many oranges as Morissette, so he brings 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.
In total, Morissette and Kyle bring 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 fruits.
True: Morissette brings a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kyle brings 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kyle also brings 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.
Kyle brings a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.
Together, Morissette and Kyle bring a total of 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.
False: Morissette brings 5 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 13 pieces of fruit. 
Kyle brings twice as many apples as Morissette, so he brings 10 apples. 
Kyle also brings half as many oranges as Morissette, so he brings 4 oranges. 
In total, Morissette and Kyle bring 15 pieces of fruit.
27.0 - 5: Let's first find the number of apples Morissette brings. She brings 5 apples. Kyle brings twice as many apples, so he brings 2 * 5 = 10 apples.  Now, let's find the number of oranges Kyle brings. Kyle brings half as many oranges as Morissette, who brings X oranges. So, Kyle brings X/2 oranges.  Then, the total number of fruit is 5 (Morissette's apples) + X (Morissette's oranges) + 10 (Kyle's apples) + X/2 (Kyle's oranges) = 27.  Therefore, the equation becomes: 5 + X + 10 + X/2 = 27 15 + 3X/2 = 27 3X/2 = 12 3X = 24 X = 8  So, Morissette brings 5 apples and 8 oranges. The answer for 'X' is 8.
15.0 - 0: Morissette brings 5 apples and X oranges. Kyle brings twice as many apples as Morissette, so he brings 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kyle also brings half as many oranges as Morissette, so he brings 0.5 * X oranges. In total, they bring 15 fruits: <code> 5 + X + 10 + 0.5X = 15  15 = 15 + 1.5X  1.5X = 0  X = 0 </code> The answer is 0.

Q: Jamal's phone can hold 6 times the number of photos as Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks Jamal photographed at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photos from the zoo?
GT : 6
True: First, we need to find the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times the number of photos as Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, we can calculate:

1,800 / 6 = 300 photos

Next, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of ducks Jamal photographed at the zoo. So, if Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos, we can calculate:

300 / 50 = 6 ducks

Therefore, Jamal photographed 6 ducks at the zoo.
True: Brittany's phone can hold 1/6 of the number of photos as Jamal's phone, so it can hold 1,800 / 6 = 300 photos.
Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of ducks Jamal photographed, the number of ducks is 300 / 50 = 6 ducks.
True: Brittany's phone can hold 1/6 of the number of photos Jamal's phone can hold, so it can hold 1,800 / 6 = 300 photos.
Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of ducks Jamal photographed at the zoo, the number of ducks in Jamal's photos is 300 / 50 = 6 ducks.

Q: John has 3 boxes. Each box measures 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The thickness of the box walls is 1 inch. What is the total volume content of all 3 boxes?
GT : 72
False: First, calculate the volume of one box without the walls:
Volume = Length x Width x Height
Volume = 5 x 6 x 4
Volume = 120 cubic inches

Next, calculate the volume of the walls for one box:
Volume walls = 2(Length x Height x Thickness) + 2(Width x Height x Thickness)
Volume walls = 2(5 x 4 x 1) + 2(6 x 4 x 1)
Volume walls = 2(20) + 2(24)
Volume walls = 40 + 48
Volume walls = 88 cubic inches

Therefore, the total volume of one box including the walls is:
Total volume = Volume + Volume walls
Total volume = 120 + 88
Total volume = 208 cubic inches

Since John has 3 identical boxes, the total volume content of all 3 boxes is:
Total volume of 3 boxes = 3 x Total volume
Total volume of 3 boxes = 3 x 208
Total volume of 3 boxes = 624 cubic inches

Therefore, the total volume content of all 3 boxes is 624 cubic inches.
False: First, calculate the volume of one box:
Volume = (length x width x height) - (inner length x inner width x inner height)
Volume = (5 x 6 x 4) - (3 x 4 x 2)
Volume = (120) - (24)
Volume = 96 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total volume of all 3 boxes would be:
Total Volume = 96 x 3
Total Volume = 288 cubic inches

Therefore, the total volume content of all 3 boxes is 288 cubic inches.
True: First, calculate the volume of each box:

Volume of one box = (5-2)*(6-2)*(4-2) = 3*4*2 = 24 cubic inches

Now, calculate the total volume content of all 3 boxes:

Total volume = 24 cubic inches * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches

Therefore, the total volume content of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.
624.0 - 0: Each box measures 5 inches by X inches by 4 inches, with 1 inch thick walls. So, the volume of each box is: Volume = (5-2) * (X-2) * (4-2) = (3) * (X-2) * (2) = 6X - 12  Since there are 3 boxes, the total volume is 3 times the volume of each box: 3 * (6X - 12) = 624 18X - 36 = 624 18X = 660 X = 36.67  The answer is 36.67 inches.
288.0 - 0: Each box has dimensions of 5 inches by X inches by 4 inches, including the thickness of the box walls. The total volume content of all 3 boxes is 288.0 cubic inches.   The volume of each box can be calculated as (5+2)(X+2)(4+2) = 288.0 Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get: (7)(X+2)(6) = 288.0 42(X+2) = 288.0 42X + 84 = 288.0 42X = 204.0 X = 204.0 / 42 X = 4.85714285714  Therefore, the answer for X is approximately 4.86 inches.
72.0 - 4: Each box has dimensions of 5x by X by 4 inches, with 1 inch thick walls all around. So the actual dimensions of the boxes are (5+2*1) by (X+2*1) by (4+2*1) inches. The total volume of all 3 boxes is 72.0 cubic inches. We can write the volume equation as follows: \[ 3 * (5+2*1) * (X+2*1) * (4+2*1) = 72.0 \] Solving this equation will give us the value of X.

True: The company spent $15,000 on advertising in one year and a third of that amount on advertising another year.

First year: $15,000
Second year: $15,000 / 3 = $5,000

Total spent over two years: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

Therefore, the company spent a total of $20,000 on advertising over those two years.
True: The company spent $15,000 on advertising in one year and a third of that amount in the other year, so they spent $15,000 + ($15,000 / 3) = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000 on advertising over those two years in total.
True: The company spent $15,000 in the first year and $15,000 / 3 = $5,000 in the second year.

Q: Tom plants 10 trees every year. He also cuts down 2 trees each year. He started with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees have died. How many trees does he have left?
GT : 91
False: After 10 years, Tom has planted 10 trees each year for a total of 10 * 10 = 100 trees planted.
He has also cut down 2 trees each year for a total of 2 * 10 = 20 trees cut down.
Initially, he had 50 trees, so after 10 years he has a total of 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.
30% of the trees have died, so 30% of 130 is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees have died.
Therefore, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left after 10 years.
False: After 10 years, Tom has planted 10 trees every year for a total of 10 * 10 = 100 trees planted.
He has also cut down 2 trees every year for a total of 10 * 2 = 20 trees cut down.
So after 10 years, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees in total.
30% of the trees have died, which means 30/100 * 130 = 39 trees have died.
Therefore, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left after 10 years.
False: After 10 years, Tom plants a total of 10 trees each year, so after 10 years he will have planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.
He also cuts down 2 trees each year, so after 10 years he will have cut down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.
He started with 50 trees, so after 10 years he will have 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees in total.
30% of the trees have died after 10 years, so 30% of 130 trees is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees have died.
Therefore, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left after 10 years.

Q: A merchant buys several bags of wheat from a farmer at 20 dollars per bag. If transporting each bag from the farm to the warehouse costs 2 dollars, and the merchant gains a total profit of 400 dollars after selling all the wheat at 30 dollars per bag, how many bags did he sell?
GT : 50
True: Let's assume the merchant bought x bags of wheat from the farmer.

The total cost for buying the wheat would be 20x dollars.

The cost of transporting each bag from the farm to the warehouse is 2 dollars per bag, so the total transportation cost would be 2x dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for the merchant would be 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.

The merchant sold each bag of wheat for 30 dollars, so the total revenue from selling x bags would be 30x dollars.

The profit for the merchant would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is 30x - 22x = 8x dollars.

Given that the merchant gained a total profit of 400 dollars, we can set up the equation:

8x = 400

Solving for x:

x = 400 / 8

x = 50

Therefore, the merchant bought and sold 50 bags of wheat.
True: Let's represent the number of bags bought from the farmer as x.

The cost of buying x bags of wheat from the farmer is 20x dollars.

The cost of transporting each bag from the farm to the warehouse is 2 dollars, so the total transportation cost is 2x dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for the merchant is 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.

The revenue from selling each bag at 30 dollars is 30x dollars.

The total profit for the merchant is the revenue minus the total cost, so it is 30x - 22x = 8x dollars.

We are given that the total profit is 400 dollars, so 8x = 400.

Solving for x, we get x = 50.

Therefore, the merchant bought and sold 50 bags of wheat.
True: Let's denote the number of bags bought by the merchant as x.

The cost of buying all the bags from the farmer is 20*x = 20x dollars.

The cost of transporting each bag from the farm to the warehouse is 2 dollars per bag, so the total transportation cost is 2*x = 2x dollars.

The total cost for the merchant is the sum of the cost of buying the bags and the transportation cost, so the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.

The revenue from selling all the bags at 30 dollars per bag is 30*x = 30x dollars.

The profit made by the merchant is the revenue minus the total cost, so the profit is 30x - 22x = 8x dollars.

Given that the profit is 400 dollars, we have:

8x = 400
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the merchant sold 50 bags of wheat.

GT : 32
True: First, let's add up all the expenses: 
$12 (cake ingredients) + $43 (birthday gift) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (gift bags) = $96 total party expenses

Since Isabel and her parents split the costs three ways, we need to divide $96 by 3:
$96 / 3 = $32 each

Each person (Isabel and her parents) would pay $32 for the party supplies.
True: First, calculate the total cost of all the party supplies: 
$12 (cake ingredients) + $43 (birthday gift) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (gift bags) = $96

Next, divide the total cost by three to find out how much each person pays:
$96 / 3 = $32

Therefore, each person pays $32 for the party supplies.
True: First, we add up all the costs: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96.

GT : 2600
True: Each candied apple weighs 20 grams since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much.
The weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams.
The weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.
The total weight of Joe's candy bag is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams.
True: First, we need to find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple must weigh 20 grams (40 grams / 2 = 20 grams).

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the weight of one chocolate bar by the number of chocolate bars: 25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/bar = 1000 grams.

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the weight of one candied apple by the number of candied apples: 80 candied apples * 20 grams/apple = 1600 grams.

Finally, we add the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's candy bag: 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

Therefore, Joe's Halloween candy bag weighs 2600 grams.
True: Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple weighs 20 grams (half the weight of the chocolate bar).

The total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams.
The total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams.

In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined. How many Pokémon cards does she have now?
GT : 320
True: First, calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month: 20 cards x 3 = 60 cards
Next, calculate the number of cards she collected in the second month: 60 cards - 20 cards = 40 cards
Now, calculate the total number of cards she collected in the first two months: 60 cards + 40 cards = 100 cards
Finally, calculate the number of cards she collected in the third month: 100 cards x 2 = 200 cards
Add up all the cards she collected: 20 cards + 60 cards + 40 cards + 200 cards = 320 cards
Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.
False: Let's break down the information given in the question:

Initial number of cards = 20
Number of cards collected in the first month = 20 * 3 = 60
Number of cards collected in the second month = 60 - 20 = 40
Number of cards collected in the third month = 2 * (20 + 40) = 2 * 60 = 120

Total number of Pokémon cards now = 20 + 60 + 40 + 120 = 240

Elaine now has 240 Pokémon cards.
True: In the first month, Elaine collected 20 * 3 = 60 cards
In the second month, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards
In the first and second months combined, she collected 60 + 40 = 100 cards
In the third month, she collected 100 * 2 = 200 cards
In total, Elaine now has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 Pokémon cards.
320.0 - 3: Elaine initially had X Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that amount, so the total in the first month would be 3X. In the second month, she collected X cards fewer than in the first month, so the total in the second month would be 3X - X = 2X. In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined, so the total in the third month would be 2(3X + 2X) = 2(5X) = 10X.  Overall, she has 320 Pokémon cards, so we can write the following equation: X + 3X + 2X + 10X = 320 16X = 320 X = 20  Therefore, the answer for 'X' is 20.
240.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given:  - Elaine initially had X Pokémon cards. - A month later, she collected three times that amount, so she had 3X cards. - In the second month, she collected X cards fewer than in the first month, so she had 3X - X = 2X cards. - In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first two months combined, so she collected 2 * (X + 3X + 2X) = 2 * 6X = 12X cards. - She now has a total of 240 Pokémon cards, so X + 3X + 2X + 12X = 240.  Solving the equation: X + 3X + 2X + 12X = 240 18X = 240 X = 240/18 X = 13.33 (rounded off to the nearest whole number)  Therefore, the answer of 'X' is 13.

True: First, calculate the total number of letters Mike receives each week from his remaining 3 pen pals:

2 letters/pen pal * 3 pen pals = 6 letters

Next, calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week:

6 letters * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages

Now, calculate how long it takes Mike to respond to all the letters he receives each week:

30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

Finally, convert the total minutes to hours:

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours per week writing letters.
True: First, let's determine how many letters Mike receives each week from his remaining 3 pen pals:

3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal = 6 letters per week

Next, let's determine how many pages Mike receives each week:

6 letters/week * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages per week

Since Mike responds in the same manner, he will also send 30 pages worth of letters each week.

Now, let's determine how many minutes Mike spends writing letters each week:

30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

Lastly, let's convert the minutes to hours:

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours per week writing letters.
False: First, let's calculate the total number of letters Mike receives per week from his pen pals:
5 pen pals x 2 letters per pen pal = 10 letters per week

Since he no longer corresponds with 2 of them, he receives:
10 letters per week - 2 letters = 8 letters per week

If each letter is 5 pages and he receives 8 letters per week, then he receives:
5 pages per letter x 8 letters = 40 pages per week

If Mike can write a page in 6 minutes, then he spends:
40 pages x 6 minutes per page = 240 minutes per week

Now we need to convert the time spent writing letters from minutes to hours:
240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 4 hours per week writing letters.
3.0 - 1: Mike used to have 5 pen pals. If he no longer corresponds with X of them, then he is corresponding with 5 - X pen pals now. Each pen pal sends X five-page letters a week, so Mike receives 5 * X letters in total. Since he responds in the same manner, he also writes 5 * X letters a week. If Mike can write a page in 6 minutes, then writing a five-page letter will take 5 * 6 = 30 minutes. If he spends 3.0 hours per week writing letters, which is equivalent to 3.0 * 60 = 180 minutes, we can create the following equation:  5 * X * 30 = 180  Solving for X:  150X = 180  X = 180 / 150  X = 1.2  Therefore, the answer of 'X' is 1.2.
4.0 - 0: Mike used to have 5 pen pals. If he no longer corresponds with 'X' of them, he will have 5 - X pen pals remaining. Each pen pal sends X five-page letters a week, so Mike receives X * 5 = 5X five-page letters total. Since he responds in the same manner, he also sends out 5X five-page letters.   If Mike can write a page in 6 minutes, then to write a five-page letter, he would spend 5 * 6 = 30 minutes per letter. So, in total, he spends 30 * 5X = 150X minutes per week writing letters. This is equivalent to 150X / 60 = 2.5X hours per week.  Given that he spends 4.0 hours per week writing letters, we can set up the following equation: 2.5X = 4.0  Solving for X: X = 4.0 / 2.5 X = 1.6  Therefore, the answer for 'X' is 1.6.

GT : 6
True: There are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, and two-thirds of them are female. 

2/3 * 9 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
False: There are 18 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, so two-thirds of them would be female. 

2/3 * 18 = 12

Therefore, there are 12 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
True: There are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, and two-thirds of them are female. 

2/3 * 9 = 6 female unicorns. 

Therefore, there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
6.0 - 1: Let's break down the information given: - A third of the total unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. - Two-thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female, which means one-third are male.  Let's denote the total number of unicorns as X. Therefore, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is (1/3)X.  Since two-thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female, we can write the following equation: (2/3)(1/3)X = 6  Solving for X: (2/9)X = 6 X = 6 * (9/2) X = 27  Therefore, the answer is that there are 27 unicorns left in the world.
12.0 - 0: Let's break it down:  - Let's say the total number of unicorns left in the world is X. - The number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is one third of X, so X/3. - Two-thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female, so 2/3 * (X/3) = 12. - Solving for X: 2/3 * (X/3) = 12 2X/9 = 12 2X = 108 X = 54  Therefore, the answer is 54.

Q: Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysat her neighbors' children 4 times, earning $5 each time. She gets $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara had already saved $10 before starting babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes?
GT : 10
True: Sara needs a total of $30 (jacket) + $20 (shoes) + $20 (shoes) = $70 to afford the jacket and shoes.
Sara has already earned $5 x 4 = $20 from babysitting.
Sara has also saved $10.
So far, Sara has $20 + $10 = $30.
Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.
Each time Sara mows the lawn, she earns $4.
Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.
False: First, we need to calculate how much money Sara has earned from babysitting and mowing the lawn. 

From babysitting, Sara earned $5 x 4 = $20. 
From mowing the lawn, she earned $4 x n, where n is the number of times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes. 

To afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, Sara needs to pay $30 (jacket) + $20 x 2 (shoes) = $70. 

Adding her previous savings, Sara has $20 + $4n + $10 = $70. 
So, $4n = $70 - $20 - $10
$4n = $40
n = 10

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.
False: To afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, Sara needs a total of $30 (jacket) + $20 (shoes) + $20 (shoes) = $70.

Sara earned $5 per babysitting session, so she earned a total of 4 sessions * $5/session = $20 from babysitting.
Sara also earned $4 per lawn mowing session, so she needs to earn an additional $70 - $20 (babysitting) = $50 through lawn mowing and her initial savings.

If Sara had already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $50 - $10 (initial savings) = $40 through lawn mowing.

Since Sara earns $4 per lawn mowing session, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.
10.0 - 3: First, let's calculate how much Sara will earn from babysitting: 4 times babysitting x $5 each time = $20  Next, let's calculate how much Sara will earn from mowing the lawn: She needs to earn $30 (jacket) + $20 (shoes) = $50 She already saved $10 So, she still needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40  Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4 So, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times  Therefore, the answer of 'X' is 10.
2.0 - 0: Let's break down the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. Jacket: $30 2 pairs of shoes: 2 x $20 = $40 Total cost = $30 + $40 = $70  Sara earns $5 for each time she babysits and $4 for each time she mows the lawn. Let's calculate her total earnings: From babysitting 4 times: 4 x $5 = $20 From mowing the lawn twice: 2 x $4 = $8 Total earnings = $20 + $8 = $28  Sara already saved $10, so her total money before buying the jacket and shoes is: Total money = $10 + $28 = $38  To afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, she needs $70. Let's calculate how much more she needs: Amount needed = Total cost - Total money = $70 - $38 = $32  To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get $32: Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4. Number of times she needs to mow the lawn = $32 / $4 = 8  Therefore, the answer to 'X' is 8, as Sara needs to mow the lawn 8 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Q: Jen is 2 years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. If Jean is now 30 years old, how old is Jen now?
GT : 23
False: Jean is 30 years old, so half of Jean's age is 30/2 = 15 years old.
Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age, which means Mark was 15+5 = 20 years old.
Since Jen is 2 years older than Mark, Jen is now 20+2 = 22 years old.
False: Jean is 30 years old, which means that two years ago she was 28 years old. Half of 28 is 14, so two years ago Mark was 5 years older than 14, making him 19 years old. Since Jen is 2 years older than Mark, she is now 21 years old.
False: Mark is 28 years old now. Jen is 30 years old now.
22.0 - 1: Let's first set up the equations based on the information given: 1. Jen is 2 years older than Mark: Jen = Mark + 2 2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age: Mark - 2 = (1/2)X + 5   Given that Jen is currently 22 years old, we can substitute this into the first equation: 22 = Mark + 2 Mark = 20  Now we can substitute Mark's age into the second equation: 20 - 2 = (1/2)X + 5 18 = (1/2)X + 5 13 = (1/2)X X = 26  Therefore, Jean is currently 26 years old.
21.0 - 1: Let's break down the information given: 1. Jen is 2 years older than Mark. 2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. 3. Jean is currently 'X' years old. 4. Jen is currently 21 years old.  From the first point, we can say: <code> Jen = Mark + 2 </code>  From the second point, let M be Mark's age two years ago and J be Jean's age two years ago. Then: <code> M = 5 + 0.5J </code>  Since Jen is currently 21 years old: <code> Jen = 21 </code>  Given that Jen is 2 years older than Mark: <code> Mark + 2 = Jen Mark + 2 = 21 Mark = 21 - 2 Mark = 19 </code>  Now, substitute Mark's age back into the equation for Jean's age two years ago: <code> M = 5 + 0.5J 19 = 5 + 0.5J 0.5J = 14 J = 28 </code>  Since Jean is currently X years old, the answer is 28.
30.0 - 0: Let's denote Mark's age as M and Jean's age as J. According to the given information: 1. Jen is 2 years older than Mark: J = M + 2 2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age: M - 2 = (1/2)J - 5  Given that Jen is currently 30 years old, we can substitute J = M + 2 into the equation: J = 30 M + 2 = 30 M = 30 - 2 M = 28  Now, substitute M = 28 into the second equation and solve for J: 28 - 2 = (1/2)J - 5 26 = (1/2)J - 5 (1/2)J = 31 J = 62  Therefore, Jean is 62 years old. The answer is 62.

Q: On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, college student Kimo has 3 one-hour classes each day. On Tuesday and Thursday, he has 2 two-hour classes each day. There are 16 weeks of school per semester. How much time does Kimo spend in class over a semester?
GT : 272
True: To calculate the total time Kimo spends in class over a semester, we first need to calculate how much time he spends in class each week.

For Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:
3 classes x 1 hour = 3 hours/day
3 hours x 3 days = 9 hours/week

For Tuesday and Thursday:
2 classes x 2 hours = 4 hours/day
4 hours x 2 days = 8 hours/week

Total hours in class per week: 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours/week

Total hours in class per semester: 17 hours/week x 16 weeks = 272 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours in class over a semester.
False: First, calculate the total hours Kimo spends in class each week:
Monday, Wednesday, Friday:
3 one-hour classes x 3 days = 9 hours
Tuesday, Thursday:
2 two-hour classes x 2 days = 4 hours

Total weekly hours: 9 hours + 4 hours = 13 hours

Now, calculate the total hours Kimo spends in class over the entire semester:
Total weekly hours x 16 weeks = 13 hours/week x 16 weeks = 208 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 208 hours in class over a semester.
False: On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kimo spends 9 hours in class each week (3 one-hour classes x 3 days = 9 hours). On Tuesday and Thursday, he spends 4 hours in class each day (2 two-hour classes x 2 days = 4 hours). So in total, he spends 13 hours in class each week.

Over 16 weeks, Kimo spends 208 hours in class (13 hours x 16 weeks = 208 hours). 

Therefore, Kimo spends 208 hours in class over a semester.
272.0 - 5: Let's first calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week: - For Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 classes x 1 hour = 3 hours per day - For Tuesday and Thursday: 2 classes x 2 hours = 4 hours per day  So, Kimo spends 3 hours on 3 days and 4 hours on 2 days, which is a total of 3 x 3 + 4 x 2 = 15 hours per week.  To find the total number of hours Kimo spends in class over 'X' weeks, we multiply the hours per week by the number of weeks: 15 hours/week x X weeks = 15X hours  Given that Kimo spends 272 hours in class over a semester, we can set up the equation: 15X = 272  Solving for X: <code> 15X = 272 X = 272 / 15 X ≈ 18.13 </code>  Therefore, approximately 18 weeks of school per semester.
208.0 - 2: Let's calculate the total hours Kimo spends in class each week: - On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 classes * 1 hour each = 3 hours/day - On Tuesday and Thursday: 2 classes * 2 hours each = 4 hours/day  So, Kimo spends a total of 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 17 hours in class per week.   If there are X weeks in a semester, then the total hours spent in class over the semester is 17 * X. We know that Kimo spends a total of 208 hours in class over a semester.   Therefore, we can write the equation: 17X = 208 X = 208 / 17 X ≈ 12  The answer is 12 weeks per semester.

GT : 7
False: Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. 

According to the given information, the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish. This can be represented as:

32 - 4 = 2F

28 = 2F

F = 14

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.
False: Let the number of fish in each aquarium be represented by F.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the given information, this difference is equal to twice the number of fish: 28 = 2F.

Solving for F, we have F = 28 / 2 = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.
False: Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is F. 

According to the information given, the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

This is also equal to twice the number of fish, so we can write the equation: 28 = 2F

Solving for F, we get F = 28 / 2 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

False: John would need to order 7 pizzas in order to have enough slices for each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices each.
False: John would need to order 7 pizzas (20 people * 4 slices per person = 80 slices needed, 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas needed. However, since pizzas are sold in whole numbers, John would need to round up to ensure each person could have 4 slices, so he would need to order 7 pizzas).
False: John needs to order 7 pizzas in order to ensure each person can have 4 slices.
4.0 - 0: If John needs to order 4 pizzas to ensure each person can have 4 slices, and he has 20 friends, then he needs a total of 4 * 20 = 80 slices. If pizzas are sold in X slices, then the equation would be:  \[ X * 4 = 80 \] \[ X = 80 / 4 \] \[ X = 20 \] Therefore, the answer is 20 slices per pizza.
7.0 - 0: John ordered 7 pizzas and wants to ensure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices. This means he needs a total of 20 x 4 = 80 slices of pizza. If each pizza has X slices, then: \[ 7X = 80 \] \[ X = 80/7 \] \[ X \approx 11.43 \]  So, the answer is that pizzas are sold in approximately 11 slices.

Q: Shawnda decides that the kids in her neighborhood could really use a bicycle tire inflation service. She decides that the best way to charge is per tire. The cost to inflate each tire is 25 cents. On the first day, 5 people come by with bicycles to inflate each tire. 3 people come to inflate all three tires on their tricycles. Lastly, one person actually comes by on a unicycle. How much money does she make that day?
GT : 5
False: Shawnda makes:

5 * 2 = $10 from the people with bicycles
3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25 from the people with tricycles
1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25 from the person with a unicycle

Total = $10 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $12.50

Shawnda makes $12.50 that day.
True: To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda makes on the first day, we need to add up the cost of inflating each tire for each type of bike.

For the 5 people with bicycles:
5 people x 2 tires per bike x $0.25 per tire = $2.50

For the 3 people with tricycles:
3 people x 3 tires per tricycle x $0.25 per tire = $2.25

For the person with a unicycle:
1 person x 1 tire x $0.25 per tire = $0.25

Total earnings for the day:
$2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

Shawnda makes $5.00 that day from inflating tires in her neighborhood.
True: First, calculate the total number of tires that need to be inflated:
5 bikes x 2 tires = 10 tires
3 tricycles x 3 tires = 9 tires
1 unicycle = 1 tire

Total tires = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Next, calculate the total amount of money she makes:
20 tires x $0.25 per tire = $5

Shawnda makes $5 that day from inflating tires.
12.5 - 0: Let's break it down:  - Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire to inflate. - 5 people come with bicycles, so she makes 25 cents x 3 tires x 5 people = $3.75. - 1 person comes with a unicycle, so she makes 25 cents x 1 tire = $0.25. - She makes a total of $12.5 that day.  Let's denote X as the number of people who come with tricycles, each having 3 tires. - Therefore, the total amount made from inflating tires on tricycles is 25 cents x 3 tires x X people = $0.75X. - Adding all the amounts made: $3.75 (bicycles) + $0.25 (unicycle) + $0.75X (tricycles) = $12.5  Now we can solve for X: <code>3.75 + 0.25 + 0.75X = 12.5 4 + 0.75X = 12.5 0.75X = 8.5 X = 11.33 (approximately) </code>  Therefore, 'X' is approximately 11.33.
5.0 - 2: Let's break it down: - 5 people come with bicycles, so that would be 5 x 2 = $10 for inflating 2 tires each. - 1 person comes with a unicycle, so that would be $0.25 for inflating 1 tire. - Let's say X people come with tricycles, so that would be X x 3 = $0.75 for inflating all three tires on each tricycle. - In total, she makes $5.00 that day. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 10 + 0.25 + 0.75X = 5 Simplify the equation: 0.75X = 5 - 10 - 0.25 0.75X = -5.25 X = -5.25 / 0.75 X = -7 Since the number of people can't be negative, there might be an error in the initial information.

Q: Three friends spent 20.25 dollars on 3 amusement park tickets. They spent 4.50 dollars less on food than they did on the tickets. They also went on two different rides, each costing 33 dollars. If they agreed to split all the costs equally, how much does each person pay?
GT : 34
True: First, let's find out how much the friends spent on food. Since they spent 4.50 dollars less on food than they did on tickets, the total spent on food is 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 dollars.

Next, let's find out the total spent on rides. Since each ride costs 33 dollars and they went on two rides, the total spent on rides is 33 * 2 = 66 dollars.

Now, let's add up all the expenses: 20.25 (tickets) + 15.75 (food) + 66 (rides) = 102 dollars.

Since the friends agreed to split all the costs equally, each person pays 102 / 3 = 34 dollars. 

Therefore, each person pays 34 dollars.
False: The total cost of the amusement park tickets is $20.25 x 3 = $60.75.

They spent $4.50 less on food, so the total cost of food is $60.75 - $4.50 = $56.25.

The total cost of the rides is $33 x 2 = $66.

Therefore, the total cost for everything is $60.75 + $56.25 + $66 = $183.

Since there are 3 friends, each person needs to pay $183 / 3 = $61.
True: The total cost of the tickets was 20.25 dollars, so each ticket cost 20.25 / 3 = 6.75 dollars.
They spent 4.50 dollars less on food, so they spent 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 dollars on food.
They also spent 33 dollars on each ride, so the total cost of the rides was 2 * 33 = 66 dollars.
The total cost of everything was 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 dollars.
Since there are three friends, each person pays 102 / 3 = 34 dollars.
34.0 - 0: Let X be the total amount spent on food. The total cost of tickets was 20.25, so the total cost of food was X. <code> 3 * 33 + X = 20.25 + X  99 + X = 20.25 + X  99 - 20.25 = X - X  78.75 = X </code> Each person pays 34.0, so the total amount spent is 34 * 3 = 102. Therefore, the total amount spent on tickets, food, and rides is 20.25 + 78.75 + 2*33 = 165. Now we can find X: <code> 165 - 102 = X  X = 63 </code> Therefore, the answer is X = 63.
61.0 - 0: Let's break down the total cost first:  - 3 amusement park tickets cost 20.25 dollars each, totaling 20.25 * 3 = 60.75 dollars. - They spent 4.50 dollars less on food, so the total food cost was 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25 dollars. - They went on 2 rides costing 33 dollars each, totaling 33 * 2 = 66 dollars.  Therefore, the total cost was 60.75 (tickets) + 56.25 (food) + 66 (rides) = 183 dollars.  Since the three friends agreed to split the cost equally, each person pays 183 / 3 = 61 dollars.  Therefore, the answer for 'X' is 183.

Q: Juliet is on the lake when her boat starts leaking. For every 10 feet she rows towards the shore, the boat takes in 2 liters of water. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. It takes 64 seconds to reach the shore. How much water does the boat take in by the time Juliet reaches the shore?
GT : 16
False: First, let's calculate how much water the boat takes in for every 10 feet Juliet rows: 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters/foot

Next, we need to find out how many feet Juliet rows in total to reach the shore: 20 feet + (16 seconds / 64 seconds) * 20 feet = 20 feet + 5 feet = 25 feet

Now we can calculate how much water the boat takes in during the entire trip: 0.2 liters/foot * 25 feet = 5 liters

Therefore, the boat takes in 5 liters of water by the time Juliet reaches the shore.
False: First, we need to find out how much water the boat takes in for every 20 feet rowed. Since for every 10 feet the boat takes in 2 liters of water, for 20 feet it would take in 4 liters of water.

In 16 seconds, Juliet rows 20 feet, so in 64 seconds she will have rowed 80 feet (20 feet x 4).

So, by the time Juliet reaches the shore, the boat will have taken in 4 liters of water for every 20 feet rowed, for a total of 16 liters of water (4 liters x 4).
True: Juliet rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she rows at a rate of 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second.
It takes 64 seconds to reach the shore, so she rows 64 * 1.25 = 80 feet in total.
For every 10 feet she rows, the boat takes in 2 liters of water, so for 80 feet she rows, the boat takes in 2 * 8 = 16 liters of water. 

Therefore, the boat takes in 16 liters of water by the time Juliet reaches the shore.
5.0 - 0: First, we need to convert 5.0 gallons to liters. 1 gallon is approximately 3.78541 liters, so 5.0 gallons is 5.0 x 3.78541 = 18.92705 liters.  Each 10 feet Juliet rows towards the shore, the boat takes in 2 liters of water. So, the total distance Juliet rowed in 64 seconds is 4 times 'X' (as she rows 10 feet every 16 seconds).  Therefore, we can write the equation: <code> 2(4X) = 18.92705  8X = 18.92705  X = 18.92705 / 8  X ≈ 2.36588 </code>  The answer is approximately 2.36588 feet.
4.0 - 0: First, we need to convert the 4.0 gallons of water to liters. Since 1 gallon is equal to 3.78541 liters, 4.0 gallons is equal to 4.0 * 3.78541 = 15.14164 liters.  Juliet rows X feet in 16 seconds, which means the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, the boat takes in 2/10 * X = 0.2X liters of water in 16 seconds.  Since it takes 64 seconds to reach the shore, the boat takes in a total of 4 times the water intake in 16 seconds. Therefore, the total water intake is 4 * 0.2X = 0.8X liters.  Setting the total water intake equal to 15.14164 liters, we have: 0.8X = 15.14164 X = 15.14164 / 0.8 X ≈ 18.92695  Therefore, the answer for X is approximately 18.93 feet.
16.0 - 1: Juliet rows X feet in total and for every 10 feet, the boat takes in 2 liters of water. So, for X feet, the boat takes in (X/10) * 2 liters of water. Given that the boat takes in 16.0 liters of water in total by the time Juliet reaches the shore, we can write the following equation: <code> (X/10) * 2 = 16.0  X/5 = 16.0  X = 16.0 * 5  X = 80 </code> The answer is 80 feet.

Q: Mandy owes Benedict 100 dollars. They agree on an interest rate of 2% per month. If Mandy can pay off the debt in 3 months, how much money does she need to pay Benedict?
GT : 106
True: After 3 months, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict with the interest is:

100 dollars + (100 * 0.02 * 3) = 100 + 6 = 106 dollars

Therefore, Mandy needs to pay Benedict 106 dollars in total.
False: To calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay Benedict after 3 months with a 2% interest rate per month, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = the total amount to be paid
P = the initial amount borrowed
r = the monthly interest rate (in decimal form)
n = the number of months

In this case:
P = 100 dollars
r = 0.02
n = 3

Plugging in the values:

A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
A = 100(1.02)^3
A = 100(1.061208)
A ≈ 106.12

Therefore, Mandy needs to pay Benedict approximately 106.12 dollars after 3 months.
True: At an interest rate of 2% per month, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months would be:

100 dollars + (100 dollars * 0.02 * 3 months) = 100 dollars + 6 dollars = 106 dollars

Therefore, Mandy would need to pay Benedict a total of 106 dollars.
106.0 - 9: Mandy owes Benedict 100 dollars and agrees on an interest rate of 2% per month. After X months, she needs to pay Benedict 106.0 dollars. The total amount Mandy needs to pay after X months can be calculated as follows: <code> 100 + (100 * 0.02 * X) = 106.0  100 + 2X = 106.0  2X = 6  X = 3 </code> So, the answer is 3 months.
3.0 - 0: Let's break down the situation: Mandy owes Benedict 100 dollars, and the interest rate is 2% per month. If Mandy can pay off the debt in X months, she needs to pay Benedict 3.0 dollars. This means that the interest accumulated over X months is $3.00.  To calculate the interest accumulated over X months: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time $3.00 = $100 * 0.02 * X $3.00 = $2 * X X = $3 / $2 X = 1.5  Therefore, the answer is that Mandy needs to pay off the debt in 1.5 months.

Q: Anakin and Roxin go to the beach today. Anakin catches 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish, while Roxin catches 5 fewer starfish and 2 fewer seahorses than Anakin, but 2 more clownfish. How many fish did they catch in total?
GT : 32
False: Anakin caught:
10 starfish
6 seahorses
3 clownfish

Roxin caught:
10 - 5 = 5 starfish
6 - 2 = 4 seahorses
3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

In total, they caught:
10 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 33 fish

Therefore, Anakin and Roxin caught 33 fish in total.
False: Let's break it down:

Anakin caught:
10 starfish
6 seahorses
3 clownfish

Roxin caught:
10 - 5 = 5 starfish
6 - 2 = 4 seahorses
3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

So in total, they caught:
10 + 5 starfish = 15 starfish
6 + 4 seahorses = 10 seahorses
3 + 5 clownfish = 8 clownfish

Therefore, Anakin and Roxin caught a total of 15 + 10 + 8 = 33 fish.
False: Anakin caught: 
10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish

Roxin caught: 
10 - 5 = 5 starfish
6 - 2 = 4 seahorses
3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Roxin caught a total of:
5 starfish + 4 seahorses + 5 clownfish = 14 fish

Together, Anakin and Roxin caught:
19 fish + 14 fish = 33 fish in total.

Q: At a dollar store, Sloan counted 100 customers entering the store on one day. The next day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers by the third day is 500, how many customers visited the store on the third day?
GT : 250
False: Let the number of customers on the first day be x.

On the second day, Sloan counted 50 more customers, so the total number of customers on the second day was x + 50.

Therefore, the total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50.

Since the total number of customers by the third day is 500, we can write the equation:

2x + 50 + x = 500
3x + 50 = 500
3x = 450
x = 150

So, on the third day, Sloan counted 150 customers.
False: Let x be the number of customers on the second day. 
So, the total number of customers on the second day is x + 100.
Then, the total number of customers on the third day is x + 100 + 50 = x + 150.
According to the given information, the total number of customers over the three days is 100 + (x + 100) + (x + 150) = 500.
Simplifying the equation, we get 250 + 2x = 500.
Subtracting 250 from both sides, we get 2x = 250.
Dividing by 2, x = 125.
So, the total number of customers on the third day is 125 + 150 = 275.
False: Let x be the number of customers on the first day.
The number of customers on the second day is x + 50.
The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50.
Since the total number of customers by the third day is 500, we have:
2x + 50 + x = 500
3x + 50 = 500
3x = 450
x = 150

So, Sloan counted 150 customers on the first day, 150 + 50 = 200 customers on the second day, and on the third day, 500 - (150 + 200) = 150 customers visited the store.
150.0 - 2: Sloan counted 100 customers entering the store on the first day. The next day, she counted X more customers than the first day. So the total number of customers on the second day was 100 + X. By the third day, the total number of customers was 500, and there were 150 customers visiting on that day. Putting this information together, we can write the following equations: 1) X + 100 = 100 + X (same number of customers on both days) 2) 100 + X + 150 = 500 (total number of customers by the third day) Solving these equations, we find that: X + 100 + X + 150 = 500 2X + 250 = 500 2X = 250 X = 125 Therefore, the answer is 125.
275.0 - 0: On the second day, Sloan counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.  Let's say the number of customers on the first day is X. The total number of customers by the third day is 500.  So we can write the following equation:  X + 150 + 275 = 500  X + 425 = 500  X = 500 - 425  X = 75  Therefore, the answer is 75.

Q: Sue lives in an interesting neighborhood. One weekend, the neighbors decided to prank Sue. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back a third of the flamingos, painted them white, and then placed these newly painted white flamingos back in Sue's front yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the group. How many more pink plastic flamingos are there than white plastic flamingos on Sunday noon?
GT : 24
True: There was originally 18 pink flamingos in Sue's yard. On Saturday, a third of them were taken back and painted white, so that means 6 of them were white. Then on Sunday, another 18 pink flamingos were added, making a total of 30 pink flamingos. So, there are 30 pink flamingos - 6 white flamingos = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday noon.
False: On Sunday noon, there are a total of 36 pink flamingos in Sue's front yard, as 18 were added on Sunday. 
There are also 6 white flamingos in Sue's front yard, as 6 pink flamingos were painted white. 
Therefore, there are 30 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday noon.
False: There were originally 18 pink flamingos placed in Sue's front yard on Friday. On Saturday, the neighbors took back 1/3 of them, which is 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and placed them back in the yard. So, after Saturday, there were 12 pink flamingos (18 - 6) and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. So, on Sunday noon, there are a total of 30 flamingos in Sue's front yard (12 pink + 6 white + 18 pink). 

There are 24 pink flamingos (12 pink on Friday + 18 added on Sunday) and 6 white flamingos. Therefore, there are 18 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos on Sunday noon.
24.0 - 1: Let's break down the problem step by step:  1. On Friday, the neighbors placed X pink flamingos in Sue's front yard. 2. On Saturday, 1/3 of the flamingos (X/3) were taken back, painted white, and placed back in the yard. So, the number of white flamingos is X/3. 3. On Sunday, X white flamingos were in the yard, and additional X pink flamingos were added. So, the total number of pink flamingos is X + X = 2X. 4. It is given that there are 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos: 2X = X/3 + 24  Now we can solve for X: 2X = X/3 + 24 Multiplying by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 6X = X + 72 Subtracting X from both sides: 5X = 72 Dividing by 5: X = 72 / 5 X = 14.4  Since we cannot have 0.4 of a flamingo, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, X is 14.  Therefore, the answer is 14.
30.0 - 0: Let's break it down step by step:  1. Initially, the neighbors placed X pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. 2. On Saturday morning, they took back a third of the flamingos, which is X/3 flamingos, painted them white, and placed them back in Sue's front yard. Therefore, there are (X - X/3) pink flamingos left in Sue's front yard. 3. On Sunday morning, they added another X pink plastic flamingos to the group. So now there are (X - X/3) + X = (4X - X)/3 pink flamingos in total. 4. It is given that there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos on Sunday noon. So we can set up the equation: pink flamingos = white flamingos + 30 (4X - X)/3 = X/3 + 30 4X - X = X + 90 3X = X + 90 2X = 90 X = 45  Therefore, the answer is X = 45.
18.0 - 0: Initially, there were X pink flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday, a third of them were taken back and painted white. So, there were (2/3)X pink flamingos left. Then, on Sunday, X more pink flamingos were added.   Given that there are 18 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sunday, we can write the following equation:  X = (2/3)X + 18  Solving for X:  3X = 2X + 54 X = 54  Therefore, the answer is 54.

True: Let x be the number of votes the loser received.
The winner received 3/4 of the votes, so they received 3/4 * 80 = 60 votes.
Since the total number of votes is 80, the loser received x votes.
Therefore, x + 60 = 80
x = 80 - 60
x = 20

GT : 5
False: Sandra needs 3 eggs for each Spanish fruit pie, so for 15 pies, she will need 3 eggs * 15 pies = 45 eggs.
Since she receives 9 eggs each time she babysits her neighbor's daughter, she will need to babysit 45 eggs / 9 eggs per basket = 5 times. 

Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times in order to make 15 Spanish fruit pies for her school's fundraising event.
True: To make 15 Spanish fruit pies, Sandra will need a total of 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.
If she receives 9 eggs every time she babysits, she will need to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times to collect enough eggs for the pies. 
Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times.
False: To make 15 Spanish fruit pies, Sandra will need a total of 15 pies x 3 eggs per pie = 45 eggs.
If Sandra receives 9 eggs every time she babysits, she will need to babysit 45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting = 5 times. 
Therefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish fruit pies for the fundraising event.
15.0 - 0: Since Sandra receives 9 eggs every time she babysits, and she needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish fruit pie, we can find the number of pies she can make with the eggs from one babysitting session as: <code> 9 / 3 = 3 </code> So, for X pies, Sandra needs to babysit X/3 times. But the problem states that she must babysit 15 times, so we have: <code> X/3 = 15  X = 15 * 3  X = 45 </code> The answer is 45.
5.0 - 8: Every time Sandra babysits, she gets 9 eggs. To make 1 Spanish fruit pie, she needs 3 eggs. So, to make X Spanish fruit pies, she needs 3X eggs.

Q: Seth is twice the age of Brooke. In two years, their combined age will be 28 years. How old is Seth this year?
GT : 16
True: Let's set up algebraic equations to solve this problem:

Let S = Seth's current age and B = Brooke's current age.

1) "Seth is twice the age of Brooke" can be represented as: S = 2B

2) "In two years, their combined age will be 28 years" can be represented as: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation:

(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
3B + 4 = 28
3B = 24
B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age is 8, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old this year.
True: Let's represent Seth's age as S and Brooke's age as B.

Given that Seth is twice the age of Brooke, we have the equation:

S = 2B

In two years, their combined age will be 28 years, so we have:

(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
S + B + 4 = 28
S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for Seth's age:

2B + B = 24
3B = 24
B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age is 8, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old this year.
True: Let x be Brooke's age. 

Therefore, Seth's age = 2x

In two years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old.

Their combined age in two years will be x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

3x + 4 = 28

3x = 24

x = 8

Therefore, Seth is currently 2(8) = 16 years old.

Q: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on gas, and gives half of the remaining salary to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200 dollars as a weekly allowance and his wife 700 dollars for daily necessities and other household items. If Zaid earns 6,000 dollars a month, how much money does he have left after paying all these expenses and making donations?
GT : 350
False: First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500 dollars
Next, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on gas: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars
Now let's calculate how much money Zaid has left after paying for rent and gas: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars
Zaid gives half of this remaining salary to charity: 2500 / 2 = 1250 dollars
After making these donations, Zaid has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left
Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars as a weekly allowance, so he spends 200 * 4 = 800 dollars on his daughter
Zaid gives his wife 700 dollars for daily necessities, so he spends 700 * 30 = 21000 dollars on his wife
Now let's subtract the money spent on his daughter and wife from the money Zaid has left: 1250 - 800 - 2100 = 750 dollars
Thus, Zaid has 750 dollars left after paying all his expenses and making donations.
False: First, let's calculate how much money Zaid spends on rent:

1/4 of 6,000 dollars = 6,000/4 = 1,500 dollars on rent

Next, let's calculate how much money Zaid spends on gas:

1/3 of 6,000 dollars = 6,000/3 = 2,000 dollars on gas

Now, let's calculate how much money Zaid has left after paying rent and gas:

6,000 - 1,500 - 2,000 = 2,500 dollars

Zaid gives half of the remaining salary to his favorite charity, so he gives:

2,500/2 = 1,250 dollars to charity

After making donations, Zaid has:

2,500 - 1,250 = 1,250 dollars left

Zaid then gives his daughter 200 dollars as a weekly allowance, so he spends:

200 x 4 = 800 dollars on his daughter

Zaid then gives his wife 700 dollars for daily necessities and other household items, so he spends:

700 x 4 = 2,800 dollars on his wife

Subtracting these expenses from the amount he has left:

1,250 - 800 - 2,800 = -1,350

Therefore, Zaid does not have any money left after paying all these expenses and making donations.
False: First, let's find out how much money Zaid spends on rent, gas, and donations:
Rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500 dollars
Gas: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars
Remaining after paying rent and gas: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars
Donation to charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250 dollars

After making donations, Zaid has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left.

Now, let's subtract the allowances for his daughter and wife:
Daughter's allowance: 200 dollars/week * 4 weeks = 800 dollars/month
Wife's expenses: 700 dollars/month
Total allowances and expenses: 800 + 700 = 1500 dollars

After paying all these expenses, Zaid has 1250 - 1500 = -250 dollars left. So, Zaid is actually in debt and needs to find a way to increase his income or reduce expenses.
750.0 - 0:  First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, gas, his daughter, and his wife: - Rent: X/4 - Gas: X/3 - Daughter allowance: 200 - Wife expenses: 700  Total expenses = (X/4) + (X/3) + 200 + 700  Now, we need to calculate Zaid's total expenses and charitable donations: Total expenses and donations = Total expenses + (1/2)*(6000 - Total expenses)  Given that Zaid has 750 left after all expenses and donations: 6000 - Total expenses = 750  Now, we can solve for X: Total expenses = (X/4) + (X/3) + 200 + 700 = (3X + 4X)/12 + 900 = 7X/12 + 900  Total expenses and donations = 7X/12 + 900 + (1/2)*(6000 - (7X/12 + 900)) = 7X/12 + 900 + 3000 - 7X/24 - 450 = 3000 + 450 + 450 + X/24 = 3000 + 750 + X/24  6000 - (3000 + 750 + X/24) = 750 3000 + 750 + X/24 = 5250 3750 + X/24 = 5250 X/24 = 1500 X = 36000  Therefore, the answer to 'X' is 36000.
-1350.0 - 0: Zaid spends X/4 of his salary on rent and X/3 on gas. After that, he gives half of the remaining salary to charity. So, the remaining amount after these expenses is:  6,000 - (X/4) - (X/3) - (1/2)*(6,000 - (X/4) - (X/3))  He then gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, so the final amount left is:  6,000 - (X/4) - (X/3) - (1/2)*(6,000 - (X/4) - (X/3)) - 200 - 700  Given that he has -1350.0 left after all these expenses and donations, we can write the equation:  6,000 - (X/4) - (X/3) - (1/2)*(6,000 - (X/4) - (X/3)) - 200 - 700 = -1350  Solving this equation will give us the value of X.
-250.0 - 0: Zaid spends X/4 of his salary on rent and X/3 on gas. After these expenses, he has 1 - X/4 - X/3 = 5X/12 remaining. He then gives half of this remaining amount to charity, leaving him with 5X/24.   He also gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, which adds up to a total of 900 dollars. Therefore, Zaid's total expenses are X/4 + X/3 + 900.  Since he earns 6,000 dollars a month and has -$250.0 left after paying all expenses and making donations, we can write the equation: 5X/24 = 6,000 - (X/4 + X/3 + 900) - 250  Solving for X: 5X/24 = 6,000 - (3X + 4X + 900) - 250 5X/24 = 6,000 - 7X - 900 - 250 5X/24 = 6,000 - 7X - 1,150 5X/24 = 4,850 - 7X 5X = 4,850 * 24 - 7X * 24 5X + 168X = 116,400 173X = 116,400 X = 116,400 / 173 X ≈ 673.42  Therefore, the answer to 'X' is approximately 673.42.

False: Tom pays $60 per week for car washes. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, he pays $60 x 52 = $3120 per year for car washes.
False: Tom pays $60 per week for car washes (4 times a week * $15 each time = $60 per week)
And $60 times 52 weeks in a year = $3,120 per year. 

Therefore, Tom pays $3,120 per year for car washes.
False: Tom pays $60 per week for car washes, which is $3120 per year.

Q: A local gas station sells gasoline for $3.00 per gallon. If you buy gasoline at this station, an app company offers a cashback of $0.20 per gallon. If someone purchases 10 gallons of gasoline, how much does the person spend on gasoline after receiving the cashback reward?
GT : 28
True: The person spends $3.00 per gallon x 10 gallons = $30.00 on gasoline.
The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon x 10 gallons = $2.00.
After receiving the cashback reward, the person spends $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00 on gasoline.
True: The cost per gallon of gasoline is $3.00 and the cashback offer is $0.20 per gallon. So, the cost after receiving the cashback would be $3.00 - $0.20 = $2.80 per gallon.

If the person purchases 10 gallons of gasoline, the total cost would be 10 gallons x $2.80 per gallon = $28.00.

Therefore, the person would spend $28.00 on gasoline after receiving the cashback reward.
True: The cost of 10 gallons of gasoline without the cashback reward would be 10 gallons x $3.00/gallon = $30.00.
With the cashback reward of $0.20 per gallon, the total cashback amount for 10 gallons would be 10 gallons x $0.20/gallon = $2.00.
Therefore, after receiving the cashback reward, the person would spend $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00 on gasoline.

Q: A watermelon farm produced 120 small watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm two months later and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be picked, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, three-quarters of the remaining melons were ripe, so she picked them all. How many melons were not ripe after these two weeks?
GT : 21
True: After Ashlyn picked 30% of the watermelons, there were 120 * 0.7 = 84 watermelons left.
Then, after she picked three-quarters of the remaining watermelons, there were 84 * 0.25 = 21 watermelons left that were not ripe.
False: After Ashlyn took home 30% of the watermelons, there were 120 * 0.70 = 84 watermelons left.
When she came back two weeks later, 84 * 0.25 = 21 watermelons were ripe and picked.
Therefore, there were 84 - 21 = 63 watermelons that were not ripe after two weeks.
True: First, Ashlyn picked 30% of the 120 small watermelons, which is 0.30 x 120 = 36 watermelons.
After Ashlyn picked 36 watermelons, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.
Then, three-quarters of the remaining watermelons were picked by Ashlyn, which is 0.75 x 84 = 63 watermelons.
Therefore, after these two weeks, there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons that were not ripe yet.
21.0 - 4: Before Ashlyn went to the farm, there were 120 small watermelons. After she picked some, 21 melons were left. Let's denote the percentage of watermelons that were ready to be picked by 'X'.  After Ashlyn picked X% of the watermelons, she took them home. So, the total number of picked watermelons would be X% of 120, which is 1.2X melons.  After two weeks, there were 21 watermelons left, which means that 120 - 1.2X - (3/4)*(120 - 1.2X) = 21  Solving this equation, we get: 120 - 1.2X - 90 + 0.9X = 21 30 - 0.3X = 21 0.3X = 9 X = 30%  So, the answer of 'X' is 30%.
63.0 - 0: Ashlyn found X% of the 120 small watermelons ready to be picked, so she took them home. This means: X% of 120 = (X/100) * 120  When she came back two weeks later, three-quarters of the remaining melons were ripe, so she picked them all. This means: 3/4 * (120 - (X/100) * 120) = 63  We can solve these two equations to find the value of X.

Q: Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, and Harriet's age is half that of Zack. If Harriet is now 21 years old, calculate the average age of these three people three years from now.
GT : 45
True: If Harriet is now 21 years old, then Zack is 42 years old (twice Harriet's age) and Adrian is 63 years old (three times Harriet's age).

Three years from now, Harriet will be 24, Zack will be 45, and Adrian will be 66.

The average age of these three people three years from now is (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 45.
True: First, we need to find Zack's age, which is twice Harriet's age. If Harriet is 21 years old, then Zack is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.
Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, so Adrian is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.
In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
In three years, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
In three years, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
The average age of these three people in three years will be (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 45.
True: First, we need to find the age of Adrian and Zack.
- Since Harriet is currently 21 years old, Adrian's age is 3 times that of Harriet, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
- Harriet's age is half that of Zack, so Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
In three years, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
In three years, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Adding their ages in three years: 24 + 66 + 45 = 135
Calculating the average age in three years: 135 / 3 = 45
Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack three years from now will be 45 years old.

Q: A customs officer at the main pier of the Seaside Clearance counts 2 containers of imported bicycles, each containing 5 bicycles. The next day more containers arrive, bringing the total number of bicycles at the pier to 30. Assuming each container holds 5 bicycles, calculate the number of containers imported the next day.
GT : 4
True: The first day, there were 2 containers x 5 bicycles = 10 bicycles at the pier.
Therefore, on the next day, there were 30 bicycles - 10 bicycles = 20 bicycles brought in.
Since each container holds 5 bicycles, there were 20 bicycles / 5 bicycles = 4 containers imported the next day.
True: The initial number of containers is 2, containing 5 bicycles each, so 2 * 5 = 10 bicycles were count in at the start.
30 bicycles - 10 bicycles = 20 bicycles were imported the next day.
As each container holds 5 bicycles, 20 bicycles / 5 bicycles per container = 4 containers were imported the next day. 

Therefore, 4 containers were imported the next day.
True: There are initially 2 containers with 5 bicycles each, totaling 2 x 5 = 10 bicycles at the pier.
So, the number of bicycles imported the next day is 30 - 10 = 20 bicycles.
Since each container holds 5 bicycles, the number of containers imported the next day is 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

Q: Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, and Fred rode it four times. Afterwards, they each decided to ride the sled twice. If each ride requires 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?
GT : 60
False: Pam used 12 tickets for the roller coaster (2 rides x 6 tickets per ride) and 4 tickets for the sled (2 rides x 6 tickets per ride), totaling 16 tickets.
Fred used 24 tickets for the roller coaster (4 rides x 6 tickets per ride) and 4 tickets for the sled (2 rides x 6 tickets per ride), totaling 28 tickets.
In total, Pam and Fred used 16 tickets + 28 tickets = 44 tickets that day.
True: First, calculate the total number of tickets Pam used for the roller coaster: 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
Then, calculate the total number of tickets Fred used for the roller coaster: 4 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets
Next, calculate the total number of tickets Pam used for the sled ride: 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
Then, calculate the total number of tickets Fred used for the sled ride: 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
Finally, add up all the tickets they used: 12 tickets + 24 tickets + 12 tickets + 12 tickets = 60 tickets 
Pam and Fred used a total of 60 tickets that day.
True: First, let's calculate how many tickets Pam used:
Pam rode the roller coaster twice, which is 2 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets
Pam also rode the sled twice, which is 2 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets
In total, Pam used 12 tickets for the roller coaster + 12 tickets for the sled = 24 tickets

Next, let's calculate how many tickets Fred used:
Fred rode the roller coaster four times, which is 4 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 24 tickets
Fred also rode the sled twice, which is 2 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 12 tickets
In total, Fred used 24 tickets for the roller coaster + 12 tickets for the sled = 36 tickets

Together, Pam and Fred used 24 tickets for Pam + 36 tickets for Fred = 60 tickets that day.
44.0 - 0: Pam rode the roller coaster twice, Fred rode it four times, and they each rode the sled twice. So, the total number of rides is 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 10. They used 44 tickets in total. If each ride requires X tickets, we can write the following equation: 10X = 44 X = 44 / 10 X = 4.4 The answer is 4.4 tickets per ride.
60.0 - 3: Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times, so that's a total of 2 + 4 = 6 rides on the roller coaster. Each ride on the roller coaster costs X tickets, so the total tickets spent on the roller coaster is 6X.  Then, they each decided to ride the sled twice, which is 2 rides each, totaling 4 rides on the sled. Since each sled ride also costs X tickets, the total tickets spent on the sled is 4X.  Adding the tickets spent on the roller coaster and the sled, we get: 6X + 4X = 60 10X = 60 X = 60 / 10 X = 6  Therefore, each ride requires 6 tickets.

Q: Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve, who lives farther, is allowed to ride a bike. Steve's place is 3 miles from school, and he rides at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim's place is 2 miles from school. If Tim can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?
GT : 4
True: First, we need to calculate how long it takes Steve to reach home. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, 3 miles is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet. 

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

Now, let's calculate how long it takes Tim to reach home. 2 miles is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve reaches home in 36 minutes, he will have to wait for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race. Therefore, the winner will wait for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.
True: First, we need to find out how long it will take each of them to get home from school.

Steve:
Distance = 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
Speed = 440 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15840 / 440
Time = 36 minutes

Tim:
Distance = 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
Speed = 264 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10560 / 264
Time = 40 minutes

Since Steve arrives home first, Tim will have to wait for 4 minutes before he finishes the race.
True: First, we need to calculate how long it will take Steve to get home from school.

Steve's distance to home: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
Steve's speed: 440 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute
Time = 36 minutes

Now, let's calculate how long it will take Tim to get home from school.

Tim's distance to home: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
Tim's speed: 264 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute
Time = 40 minutes

Since Steve will take 36 minutes and Tim will take 40 minutes to get home, the winner (Steve) will wait at home for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

Q: Katie brews coffee at a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water. If the total amount of sugar and water she used equals 120 teaspoons and cups, calculate how many teaspoons of sugar she used.
GT : 42
False: Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar Katie used.

Therefore, the number of cups of water Katie used is 120 - x.

From the given ratio, we can set up the equation:

7x = 13(120 - x)

7x = 1560 - 13x

20x = 1560

x = 78

Katie used 78 teaspoons of sugar.
True: Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

According to the ratio, the number of cups of water used is 13/7 * x = 13x/7.

Since the total amount of sugar and water used equals 120 teaspoons and cups, we can set up the equation:
x + 13x/7 = 120
Multiplying through by 7 to get rid of the fraction:
7x + 13x = 840
20x = 840
x = 42

Therefore, Katie used 42 teaspoons of sugar.
True: Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar Katie used.

According to the given ratio, the number of cups of water she used would be 13/7*x.

The total amount of sugar and water she used is x + 13/7*x = 120.

Combining like terms, we get 20/7*x = 120.

Multiplying both sides by 7/20, we get x = 42.

Therefore, Katie used 42 teaspoons of sugar.
78.0 - 0: Katie brews coffee at a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water. If the total amount of sugar and water she used equals X teaspoons and cups. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13.  So, let's calculate the total amount of sugar and water she used first: 7 teaspoons of sugar * (X/20) = X teaspoons 13 cups of water * (X/20) = X cups  Given that the answer is 78.0, we can set up the equation: X + X = 78 2X = 78 X = 39  Therefore, the total amount of sugar and water Katie used is 39 teaspoons and 39 cups. The amount of sugar used is 7 teaspoons per 20 units, so let's calculate the total amount of sugar: 7 teaspoons * (39/20) = 13.65 teaspoons  The answer, as given, is indeed 78.0.
42.0 - 0: The ratio of sugar to water is 7 teaspoons to 13 cups. If the total amount of sugar and water she used equals X teaspoons and cups, and the answer is 42.0 teaspoons of sugar, we can set up the equation as:  7/x = 42/13  Solving for X:  7/x = 42/13 7 = 42x/13 91 = 42x x = 91/42 x = 2.17  Therefore, the answer of 'X' is 2.17.

Q: Blake and Kelly have a contest to see who can run the farthest in 15 minutes. They decide to race on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?
GT : 80
False: First, we need to find out how far each person ran:

- Blake ran 15 times back and forth on a 100-yard field, so he ran a total of 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran back and forth on a 100-yard field once, so she ran a total of 2 * 100 = 200 yards each time. She did this 34 times, so she ran a total of 200 * 34 = 6800 yards.

Now we can calculate the difference in distance:

- Kelly ran 6800 yards and Blake ran 3000 yards, so Kelly ran 6800 - 3000 = 3800 yards farther than Blake. 

Therefore, the winner (Kelly) ran 3800 yards farther than the loser (Blake).
False: To find out how far each person ran, we first need to calculate the total distance covered by both Blake and Kelly.

Blake ran 15 times back and forth on the 100-yard field, so he ran a total of 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly initially ran back and forth once on the 100-yard field, covering 100 yards. After that, she ran to the 40-yard line and back, covering 80 yards each time. Since she did this 34 times, her total distance covered is (1 * 100) + (34 * 80) = 2920 yards.

Now we can compare the total distance run by Blake and Kelly. Since Kelly ran 2920 yards and Blake ran 1500 yards, the difference in distance run by the winner and loser is 2920 - 1500 = 1420 yards.

Therefore, the winner ran 1420 yards farther than the loser in the 15-minute race.
False: To find out how far each person ran in total, we need to calculate the distance for each of them.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field:
15 x 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly ran back and forth to the 40-yard line 34 times:
34 x 2 x 40 yards = 2720 yards

Now, we can calculate the difference in distance between them:
2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

Therefore, Kelly ran 1220 yards farther than Blake in the race.
3800.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given:  - Blake runs back and forth 'X' times on a 100-yard football field, which means he covers a total distance of 200 yards * X times. - Kelly runs back and forth once on the football field, covering a distance of 200 yards. - Kelly eventually runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, covering a distance of 80 yards * 34 times.  The total distance covered by Blake and Kelly can be represented as:  Total distance covered by Blake = 200 * X  Total distance covered by Kelly = 200 + (80 * 34)  Given that the winner runs 3800.0 units farther than the loser, we can set up the equation:  200 * X + 3800 = 200 + (80 * 34)  Now we solve for X:  200 * X + 3800 = 200 + 2720 200 * X = 1920 X = 1920 / 200 X = 9.6  Therefore, the answer for 'X' is 9.6.
15.0 - 1: Let's break it down:  - Blake runs back and forth X times on the 100-yard field. - Kelly runs back and forth once, then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. - The winner runs 15.0 units farther than the loser.  Given that the football field is 100 yards, and Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, she is covering 80 yards each time she runs. With 34 repetitions, she covers 80 x 34 = 2720 yards.  Let's set up the equation to find X:  Blake distance = X times on the 100-yard field = 100 * 2 * X = 200X yards Kelly distance = 2720 yards  According to the given information, the winner runs 15.0 units farther than the loser, so: 200X + 15 = 2720  Solving for X: 200X = 2720 - 15 200X = 2705 X = 2705 / 200 X ≈ 13.525  Therefore, the answer for X is approximately 13.525 minutes.
1220.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given:  - Blake runs back and forth X times on a 100-yard football field. - Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. - The winner runs 1220.0 units farther than the loser.  We can set up equations to represent the distances run by Blake and Kelly:  For Blake: Distance = 100*2*X yards For Kelly: Distance = (100*2 + 80)*34 yards  Since the winner runs 1220.0 units farther than the loser: 100*2*X - (100*2 + 80)*34 = 1220  Now, we can solve for X:  200X - 280*34 = 1220 200X - 9520 = 1220 200X = 10740 X = 53.7  Therefore, the answer for 'X' is 53.7 minutes.

True:  To afford the purchase of the shoes and belt, Lori needs to work for a total of $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.
If Lori earns $8.00 per hour, she would need to work $352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours in order to afford the purchase.
False: To afford the purchase of the shoes priced at $320.00 and the belt for $32.00, Lori will need to pay a total of $352.00 ($320.00 + $32.00).

If she earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job, she will need to work for 44 hours ($352.00 / $8.00 per hour) to afford the purchase.
True: To afford the shoes and belt, Lori needs to work a total of $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Dividing the total amount by her hourly earnings gives us $352.00 / $8.00 per hour = 44 hours.

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to afford the purchase.
44.0 - 0: To find how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and belt first: 320 + 32 = $352 Then, we can calculate how many hours she needs to work by dividing the total cost by her hourly rate: 352 / 8 = 44 Therefore, the answer of 'X' is 44.
8.0 - 0: To calculate the total cost of the shoes and belt, we add the prices together: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.  To calculate how much Lori will earn in 8 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours worked: $8.00 x 8.0 hours = $64.00.  To find out how much more money Lori needs to afford the purchase, we subtract her earnings from the total cost: $352.00 - $64.00 = $288.00.  Therefore, the answer is $288.00.

Q: John spends $2 on milk, $3 on eggs, $3 on light bulbs, $3 on cups, and $4 on a cockroach trap. If all non-food items are subject to a 10% tax, how much does everything cost?
GT : 16
True: First, calculate the total cost of the non-food items (light bulbs, cups, and cockroach trap) before tax: 
$3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Then, calculate the tax on the non-food items: 
10% of $10 = $1

Add the tax to the total cost of non-food items to get the total cost before tax on food items: 
$10 + $1 = $11

Finally, add the cost of food items to get the total cost: 
$11 + $2 + $3 = $16

Therefore, everything costs $16.
False: John spends $2 on milk + $3 on eggs + $3 on light bulbs + $3 on cups + $4 on a cockroach trap = $15 total before tax.

Non-food items total $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $13, which is subject to a 10% tax.

So, $13 x 10% = $1.30 tax.

Therefore, the total cost is $15 (before tax) + $1.30 (tax) = $16.30.
False: The total cost of non-food items before tax is $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $13. 
The tax on non-food items is 10% of $13, which is $1.30. 
Therefore, the total cost of all items including tax is $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 + $1.30 = $16.30.
16.0 - 0: Let's set up the equation:  2 + X + X + X + 4 + 0.1*(3X) = 16.0  Combine like terms:  2 + 4 + 0.1*(3X) = 16.0 6 + 0.3X = 16.0  Subtract 6 from both sides: 0.3X = 10  Divide by 0.3: X = 10 / 0.3 X = 33.33  Therefore, the answer is X = 33.33
16.3 - 5: Let's denote the cost of eggs, light bulbs, and cups as 'X'. Then we can write the equation for the total cost: <code> 2 + X + X + X + 4 + 0.10(3X + 4) = 16.3  2 + 3X + 4 + 0.10(3X + 4) = 16.3  3X + 6 + 0.3X + 0.4 = 16.3  3.3X = 9.9  X = 3 </code> The answer is 3.

Q: Lam uses a lot of pens. He found that he could save money by mixing the ink of five empty pens to make one full pen. If he bought 25 pens and then used them to make new pens when the ink was almost gone, how many full pens does he get?
GT : 31
False: If Lam buys 25 pens and mixes the ink of five empty pens to make one full pen, he will end up with 5 new full pens for every 25 pens he buys. So if he were to use all 25 pens to make new pens when the ink was almost gone, he would end up with 5 full pens.
False: If Lam can make one full pen by combining the ink of five empty pens, then 25 pens can be used to create 25/5 = 5 full pens.
False: 

If Lam can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens, then with 25 pens, he can make:

25 / 5 = 5 full pens

Therefore, Lam can make 5 full pens with the ink from 25 pens.
5.0 - 1: If Lam bought X pens and used the ink of 5 empty pens to make one full pen, then he would have 5 full pens in total. So, we can write the following equation: X + 5 = 5 X = 5 - 5 X = 0  The answer is 0.
25.0 - 0: Lam bought X pens initially. After using the ink from those pens to make new ones, he ended up with 25 full pens. Since he used the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, the equation can be written as: X/5 = 25 X = 25 * 5 X = 125 So, the answer is 125.

Q: Billy is peeling and chopping potatoes, preparing to make potato salad for his large family reunion barbecue. This is a grand event, so he has to prepare 60 potatoes. The potatoes are roughly the same size, and it takes about the same time to peel and chop each potato. Billy takes about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to chop a potato. How long does it take Billy to prepare these potatoes?
GT : 95
False: To peel 60 potatoes at 1.5 minutes per potato, it will take Billy 90 minutes (1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes) to peel all the potatoes. 
To chop 60 potatoes at 5 seconds per potato, it will take Billy 5 minutes (5 seconds * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds, 300 seconds / 60 seconds = 5 minutes) to chop all the potatoes. 
Therefore, it will take Billy a total of 95 minutes (90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes) to prepare all 60 potatoes for the potato salad.
False: It takes Billy approximately 1.75 minutes (1 minute and 45 seconds) to prepare each potato (1.5 minutes to peel + 0.08 minutes to chop = 1.58 minutes total). 
Therefore, to prepare 60 potatoes, it will take him 1.58 minutes per potato * 60 potatoes = 94.8 minutes. 
So, it will take Billy approximately 94.8 minutes to prepare all 60 potatoes for the family reunion barbecue.
False: To prepare 60 potatoes, Billy will spend 1.5 minutes peeling each potato and 0.083 minutes (or 5 seconds) chopping each potato. 

The total time Billy will spend peeling all 60 potatoes is 60 potatoes x 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes. 
The total time Billy will spend chopping all 60 potatoes is 60 potatoes x 0.083 minutes per potato = 5 minutes. 

So, the total time it will take Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes is 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (chopping) = 95 minutes. 

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to prepare all 60 potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.

Q: The price of a pen is the total price of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs 1.20 dollars, and an eraser costs 0.30 dollars. How much do 8 pens cost?
GT : 12
True: First, we need to calculate the price of one pen:
Pencil cost = $1.20
Eraser cost = $0.30
Total cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of 8 pens:
Total cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8 = $12

Therefore, 8 pens cost $12.
True: First, we need to find the total price of a pen. Since a pen is the price of a pencil and an eraser combined, the total price of a pen is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Now, to find the total cost of 8 pens, we simply multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

8 pens * $1.50 = $12

Therefore, 8 pens cost $12.
True: First, we need to calculate the price of one pen. 

The price of one pen is 1.20 (pencil) + 0.30 (eraser) = 1.50 dollars.

Now, to find the total price of 8 pens, we multiply the price of one pen by 8:

1.50 (price of one pen) x 8 = 12 dollars.

Therefore, 8 pens cost 12 dollars.

On Wednesday, he watched several episodes, each lasting 30 minutes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one episode lasting 1 hour and one episode lasting 30 minutes. On Friday, since it was the weekend, he was allowed to stay up late and watched two episodes, each lasting 1 hour. If he watched a total of 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?
GT : 3
True: On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes x 1 hour each = 2 hours.
On Wednesday, Frankie watched several 30-minute episodes, which is equivalent to 30 minutes x number of episodes.
On Thursday, Frankie watched 1 episode x 1 hour + 1 episode x 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, Frankie watched 2 episodes x 1 hour each = 2 hours.
Adding up all the TV time, Frankie watched a total of 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours from Monday to Friday.
To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we subtract 5.5 hours from his total TV time of 7 hours, leaving us with 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.
Since each 30-minute episode equals 0.5 hours, Frankie watched 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes on Wednesday.
False: Frankie watched a total of 5 episodes on Monday and Tuesday (2 episodes x 1 hour each + 2 episodes x 1 hour each = 4 hours)
On Wednesday, he watched a total of 3 hours of TV (several episodes x 30 minutes each = 3 hours)
On Thursday, he watched a total of 1.5 hours of TV (1 episode x 1 hour + 1 episode x 30 minutes = 1.5 hours)
On Friday, he watched a total of 2 hours of TV (2 episodes x 1 hour each = 2 hours)
Adding up all the hours he watched, Frankie watched a total of 10.5 hours of TV.
Since the total hours he watched was 7 hours, there is an error in the question as it is not possible for him to watch 7 hours of TV.
False: On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a total of 2 episodes x 1 hour each = 2 hours.
On Thursday, he watched a total of 1 episode x 1 hour + 1 episode x 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched a total of 2 episodes x 1 hour each = 2 hours.
So, before Wednesday, he had already watched a total of 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.
This means he watched a total of 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.
Since each episode on Wednesday lasted 30 minutes, he watched 1.5 hours ÷ 0.5 hours = 3 episodes on Wednesday. 
Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.
3.0 - 3: Let's break down the information given: - On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one episode each night, each lasting X hours. - On Wednesday, he watched several episodes, each lasting 30 minutes (0.5 hours). - On Thursday, he watched one episode lasting X hours and one episode lasting 30 minutes (0.5 hours). - On Friday, he watched two episodes, each lasting X hours. - In total, he watched 7 hours of TV. - On Wednesday, he watched 3.0 30-minute episodes, which means he watched 1.5 hours of TV.  Now, let's set up the equation based on the information given: <code> (Monday + Tuesday) + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday = 7  2*X + (number of episodes on Wednesday * 0.5) + X + 0.5 + 2*X = 7 2*X + 1.5 + 2.5*X = 7 5*X + 1.5 = 7 5*X = 5.5 X = 5.5 / 5 X = 1.1 </code>  The answer is 1.1 hours for each episode.
7.0 - 0: Let's break down the information given: - On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watches 2 episodes, each lasting X hours. - On Wednesday, he watches a total of 7 30-minute episodes, which is equal to 3.5 hours. - On Thursday, he watches 2 episodes, one lasting X hours and one lasting 0.5 hours. - On Friday, he watches 2 episodes, each lasting X hours. - In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.  Now we can write the equation based on the information given: <code> 2X + 3.5 + X + 0.5 + 2X = 7  5X + 4 = 7  5X = 3  X = 3/5  X = 0.6 </code> The answer is 0.6.
30.0 - 0: Let's break down the total TV watching time for each day:  Monday: 2 episodes * X hours each = 2X hours Tuesday: 2 episodes * X hours each = 2X hours Wednesday: 30-minute episodes * 30 = 30 * 30 = 900 minutes = 15 hours Thursday: 1 episode * X hours + 1 episode * 0.5 hour = X + 0.5 hours Friday: 2 episodes * X hours = 2X hours  Total TV watching time = 2X + 2X + 15 + X + 0.5 + 2X = 7 hours  Combined like terms: 5X + 15.5 = 7 5X = 7 - 15.5 5X = 8.5 X = 8.5 / 5  X = 1.7  The answer is 1.7 hours for each episode.

Janet now has 98 pens.
True: Janet now has:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + (6 packs of blue pens x 9 blue pens per pack) + (2 packs of red pens x 6 red pens per pack) = 22 + 10 + (6 x 9) + (2 x 6) = 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.

GT : 20
False: Let's break this down step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, leaving Griffin with 24-5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2*5 = 10 fries from Griffin.
4. After Billy took his fries, Griffin had 19-10 = 9 fries.
5. Jinje gave Griffin some fries, let's call this number X.
6. After Jinje gave Griffin X fries, Griffin had 9+X fries.
7. Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so he took 5-3 = 2 fries from Griffin.
8. We now have the equation: Griffin's final count of fries = 27 = 9+X
9. Solving for X, we find that Jinje gave Griffin X = 27-9 = 18 fries.

Therefore, Jinje gave Griffin 18 fries.
False: Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
4. This left Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
5. Jinje gave Griffin some of her fries, so now Griffin has 9 + x fries.
6. Colby took 3 less than Kyle did, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
7. This left Griffin with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
8. Finally, we know that Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so 9 + x = 27.
9. Solving for x, we find that Jinje gave Griffin 27 - 9 = 18 fries.

Therefore, Jinje gave Griffin 18 fries.
True: Let x be the number of fries Jinje gave to Griffin. 

After Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries. 
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. 
After Billy took his fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries. 
Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 
After Colby took his fries, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries. 
Jinje gave Griffin x fries, so Griffin ended up with 7 + x = 27 fries. 
Therefore, x = 27 - 7 = 20 fries. 

Jinje gave Griffin 20 fries.
18.0 - 0: Let's break down the steps:  1. Griffin had 24 fries. 2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries. 3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. 4. After Kyle and Billy took fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries. 5. Jinje gave Griffin 18 fries, so Griffin had 9 + 18 = 27 fries. 6. Colby took X less than Kyle did. Since Colby took less than Kyle, X must be less than 5. 7. Finally, Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so the equation is: 9 - X = 27. 8. Solving for X: X = 9 - 27 = -18.  Therefore, the answer is X = -18.
20.0 - 7: Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. After Billy took fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries. Jinje gave Griffin 20.0 fries, so Griffin had 9 + 20 = 29 fries. Colby took X less than Kyle did, so Colby took 5 - X fries. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, we can write the following equation:  29 - (5 - X) = 27 29 - 5 + X = 27 24 + X = 27 X = 27 - 24 X = 3  Therefore, the answer is 3.

Q: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% every two months, how much does a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?
GT : 92
False: After 36 months, the price would have increased 18 times (36 months/2 months per increase) by 20%. 
So, the price would be:
$20 * (1 + 0.20)^18 = $20 * 3.035 = $60.70

Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost $60.70 after 36 months.
False: To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to find the total number of price increases over the 36 months.

Since the price increases by 20% every two months, there are 36 / 2 = 18 price increases over 36 months.

The cost of the bag of marbles after each 2-month period can be calculated as follows:
1. At the start: $20
2. After 2 months: $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24
3. After 4 months: $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
4. After 6 months: $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
5. And so on...

After 18 price increases, the cost of the bag of marbles would be:
$20 * (1.2)^18 ≈ $20 * 9.269 = $185.38

Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $185.38 after 36 months.
False: After 36 months, the price of the bag of marbles increases in 18 intervals of two months (36 months / 2 months per interval = 18 intervals).

Each interval increases the price by 20%, so the total increase over 18 intervals is calculated as follows:
(20% increase)^18 intervals = (1.20)^18 = approximately 19.39

Therefore, after 36 months, the price of the bag of marbles would be:
$20 x 19.39 ≈ $387.87

Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $387.87 after 36 months of price increases every two months.

If each pepper costs $15, then the price of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, calculate the price of an orange:
If the price of an orange is $5 less than the price of a watermelon, then the price of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, calculate the total cost of the watermelons:
Dylan bought 4 watermelons at $45 each, so he spent 4 * $45 = $180 on watermelons.

Next, calculate the total cost of the peppers:
Dylan bought 20 peppers at $15 each, so he spent 20 * $15 = $300 on peppers.

Finally, calculate the total cost of the oranges:
Dylan bought 10 oranges at $40 each, so he spent 10 * $40 = $400 on oranges.

Now, add up the total cost of each item to find out how much Dylan spent in total:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Dylan spent $880 in total.
True: First, we need to find the price of a watermelon and an orange.

Since the price of a watermelon is three times the price of a pepper, and each pepper costs $15, the price of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Then, the price of an orange is $5 less than the price of a watermelon, so the price of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Dylan bought 4 watermelons at $45 each, so he spent 4 * $45 = $180 on watermelons.
He bought 20 peppers at $15 each, so he spent 20 * $15 = $300 on peppers.
He also bought 10 oranges at $40 each, so he spent 10 * $40 = $400 on oranges.

In total, Dylan spent $180 + $300 + $400 = $880 at the store.

Q: Kelly and Robert enjoy collecting shells on the beach. On Monday, Kelly collected 5 more shells than Robert, who collected 20 shells. On Tuesday, Kelly collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday. How many shells did Kelly collect on Tuesday?
GT : 50
True: On Monday, Kelly collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells.
On Tuesday, Kelly collected 25 x 2 = 50 shells. 
Thus, Kelly collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
True: Kelly collected 25 shells on Monday (20 + 5 = 25)
On Tuesday, Kelly collected 2 * 25 = 50 shells. 
Therefore, Kelly collected 50 shells on Tuesday.
True: On Monday, Kelly collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells.
On Tuesday, Kelly collected 25 x 2 = 50 shells. 
Therefore, Kelly collected 50 shells on Tuesday.

Q: Rosie can run 3 hours at 10 miles per hour. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours?
GT : 50
False: In the first 3 hours, Rosie can run 10 miles per hour x 3 hours = 30 miles.
In the remaining 4 hours, she can run 5 miles per hour x 4 hours = 20 miles.
Therefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles in 7 hours.
False: Rosie can run 30 miles in the first 3 hours (10 miles per hour x 3 hours = 30 miles).
Then, she can run 15 miles in the next 4 hours (5 miles per hour x 4 hours = 20 miles).
Therefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 miles + 15 miles = 45 miles in 7 hours.
False: First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour:

3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles

Next, let's calculate how far she can run in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:

4 hours * 5 miles per hour = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she ran in the first 3 hours with the distance she ran in the remaining 4 hours:

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

Q: Jack is visiting an insect museum. He sees 80 spiders (each with 8 legs), 90 insects (each with 6 legs), and 3 rare invertebrates (each with 10 legs). How many legs does Jack see in total?
GT : 1210
True: Jack sees a total of 80 spiders x 8 legs per spider = 640 spider legs.
He also sees 90 insects x 6 legs per insect = 540 insect legs.
And finally, he sees 3 rare invertebrates x 10 legs per invertebrate = 30 rare invertebrate legs.
Therefore, Jack sees a total of 640 spider legs + 540 insect legs + 30 rare invertebrate legs = 1210 legs in total.
True: Jack sees a total of (80 spiders * 8 legs) + (90 insects * 6 legs) + (3 rare invertebrates * 10 legs) = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs in total.
True: Jack sees (80 spiders x 8 legs) + (90 insects x 6 legs) + (3 rare invertebrates x 10 legs) = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs in total.
